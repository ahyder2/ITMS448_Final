So he knows Embiid has a fire inside him.,"https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/philadelphia-sixers-dwight-howard-doc-rivers-daryl-morey-joel-embiid-20201125.html

by Keith Pompey, Posted: November 25, 2020- 7:00 PM

Dwight Howard is determined to win personal back-to-back NBA titles.

The reserve center helped the Los Angeles Lakers win their 17th NBA title in October.

Now a 76er, he’s focused on winning another one next season. He made that obvious Saturday on Twitter after signing a one-year deal.

He also expressed his desire to win the title during a brief interview Monday after arriving in Philly. And he triple-downed on it during Wednesday’s introductory Zoom call with local media.

“I believe that this is our year,” Howard said. “It’s been a long time since 1983 [when the Sixers last won an NBA title]. So I think it’s time that we hoist up another banner here in Philly.”

A lot of the Sixers’ success will depend on all-stars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, the team’s cornerstones.

Howard saw Embiid cry after losing to the Toronto Raptors in Game 7 of Eastern Conference semifinals in 2019. He remembers the pain the center felt after giving everything he had.

Howard said it’s a pain that stays with a player for a long time. So he knows Embiid has a fire inside him.

This upcoming season is about being focused. Howard sees focus in Embiid and Simmons.

“That’s where it starts, with our two best players,” Howard said. “And then you look at the rest of the guys on the team. They’ve all been hungry. They just never knew how to win.”

That’s where Howard and swingman Danny Green come in.

The Sixers acquired Green and Terrance Ferguson from the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Al Horford, a protected 2025 first-round pick, the 34th overall pick in last week’s draft, and the rights to Serbian point guard Vasilije Micic.

Green was a starting guard on the Lakers’ championship team before being traded to the Thunder this offseason.

It was Green’s second straight NBA title and third overall. He won the 2019 title with the Raptors and in 2014 with the San Antonio Spurs.

“We all know what it takes to really get to the next level,” Howard said. “I think it’s a really great opportunity.”

New coach Doc Rivers also knows what it takes. He coached the Boston Celtics to the 2008 title. Howard said Rivers is always talking about winning and the importance of it.

“I think that this year, with the focus that this team will have and the drive that we have to be successful, this will be our year,” Howard said.

Rivers was actually a major reason why Howard came to Philadelphia following a free-agent miscommunications with the Lakers.

The free-agency period began at 6 p.m. last Friday. Rivers was the only NBA coach to call him during the process. He told Howard the Sixers wanted him. Then the team’s new president of basketball operations Daryl Morey called him.

“I said this is where I need to be right now,” Howard said. “This is where my journey is calling me, to Philly. I was super happy that Doc called me and gave me this opportunity.”

This move reunites Howard with Morey. As the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Morey signed Howard to a three-year, $70 million free-agent contract in July 2013.

This time, the soon-to-be-35-year-old signed for a cap friendly guaranteed veteran minimum deal of $2.56 million.

But for Howard, it’s not about making money or obtaining individual accolades.

He’s already made more than $243 million during his 17 seasons in the league. The Orlando Magic’s first-overall pick of the 2004 draft is an eight-time All-Star and three-time defensive player of the year. He has averaged 16.7 points, 12.3 rebounds, 1.9 blocks in 1,113 career games, with 1,045 starts.

Yet, his most gratifying campaign came while averaging 7.5 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.1 blocks this past season as the Lakers’ backup center.

“Winning the championship was everything,” Howard said. “It made me realize that I have the best stats in the world, and it don’t mean nothing.”

He won a championship, yet there were games where he didn’t score a bucket. There were other games that he didn’t play at all.

“So, what really matters is holding up that trophy,” Howard said. “And that would be my message to everybody on the team. What are you willing to give up to get the trophy?”",KagsTheOneAndOnly,k1ezpd,467,6014,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k1ezpd/pompey_howard_saw_embiid_cry_after_losing_to_the/,2020-11-26 15:11:49
"[Rooks] Ujiri had been waking Kawhi up with his noisy workouts for weeks, but Kawhi was reluctant to say anything.","From Taylor Rooks new article about the bubble:

>Pro athletes are already creatures of habit, but the limitations of the bubble forced a lot of the people inside it to adopt routines in order to preserve their sanity.

>For example, every day at 5 a.m., inside room 950 in the Gran Destino (where all the top-seeded teams stayed), Masai Ujiri would wake up, read his book, hop on the Peloton, and work out before heading down for breakfast. He thought nothing of his daily ritual until one morning, several weeks into the bubble, when he got a text from another former player of his: “Morning boss, you good up there?”

>The text was from Kawhi Leonard—Finals MVP with the Raptors, now a star on the Clippers—who was staying in room 850, directly below his old boss. Ujiri had been waking Kawhi up with his noisy workouts for weeks, but Kawhi was reluctant to say anything.

>Ujiri told Kawhi that he would stop for the time being and joked that he would continue again when the Raptors met the Clippers in the Finals, messing with Kawhi's sleep. Kawhi responded with the kind of trash talk that's best read aloud in Kawhi's dry monotone: “Haha, you know the saying ‘Don't poke the bear’? I'm gonna call the NBA on you…get you out the bubble.”

"The Detroit Pistons CANNOT trade a SINGLE future draft pick as of now. The pick traded to the Rockets is protected for 8 years, meaning the picks for 8 years are untradeable. They also traded the rest of their seconds to the Clippers. Meaning they can trade only 3 Second Rounders","This is really unusual and probably means that at some point in the future, when detroit is looking to contend and make win now moves with their draft picks, they'll end up renegotiating their protections with Houston to make the pick convey sooner.

Their future picks will only become tradeable once the pick to Houston conveys

New Pistons GM Troy Weaver keeps making some headscratching moves

Does he plan for the Pistons to not be in win-now mode for the next 8 years?

The first pick they'll be able to trade, without any renegotiation is in 2029, and even that one is only tradeable 2 years from now

In order to compare the 2 defenders, I watched a lot of historic films, compiled evidence and created their defensive profiles, I focused on every aspect of defense, what they were good at it, bad at, how they helped their teams, their defensive prime and careers, etc. I don’t use any accolades or awards, this is mostly based on re-watching countless hours of games and looking at historic film and paying some attention to advanced stats to contextualize the information. I don’t pay as much attention to advanced stats as I recognize they’re not perfect, they do give a fair idea and help in providing substance.

I watched regular season games to look at defensive fundamentals, tendencies, how frequently they make mistakes, what defensive skills they possess. And I used playoff games to track their one on one match ups when they guard stars like Kevin Durant, Magic Johnson, Tony Parker, Isiah Thomas, etc. I also paid attention to how many ‘good’ or ‘bad’ rotations they made, how much rim protection they offer, how many gambles, etc. 

So here are the two players:

# [LEBRON JAMES](https://imgur.com/gallery/i7wZOZ0) 

Lebron James is a 6’9, 250lb freak of nature, who is considered one of the most athletic basketball players in the history of the game. He has a 7’0 ft wingspan and he has a hand-span of 9.25 inches which is actually below average for his height. Really quick, really agile for his height, physically dominant and insanely powerful. Lebron has a 44 inch vertical and he is quick off the floor. A perfect mix of speed and strength.

# Defensive Profile

Coming into the league as an 18 year old, Lebron was this super athletic raw player who needed time to develop into something positive on the defensive end. From 2003/04 to 2007/08 he was a slightly above average defender who had a lot of highlight plays but a lot of breakdowns too. His first major leap to being an elite defender was in 2008/09, after 5 years in the league, Lebron had become an excellent defender. 

Starting things off with his man defense, Lebron for the most part of his career was a really good one on one defender, often guarding the best guard or wing on the opposing team. His athleticism and combination of lateral quickness and strength help him keep offensive players in front of him. He is really good at limiting drives to the basket and making the offensive players take tougher jump shots, something he wants them to do. Early on in his career he didn’t have the best footwork, this affected his ability to defend in space and often led to easy baskets. Over the years his footwork improved significantly and he became a better individual defender.

[Lebron guards Joe Johnson 1v1. Does a great job of keeping him in front uses his size to make it a difficult shot and then blocks the shot.](https://youtu.be/8kRWQPfjJz0) 

It’s really hard to beat a prime Lebron off the dribble, his 6’9 frame and explosiveness makes it difficult for anyone going against him. Lebron was one of the better man to man defenders in his prime, however he wasn’t at an all time level. 

Lebron did get beat a few times too often for me to call him an all time one on one defender. Elite ball handlers and quick guys would blow past him once in a while. For the most part he shifted his feet well, but he did have errors on a more consistent basis than Michael Jordan for example. 

He got beat off the dribble a fair few times by elite ball handlers, a touch bit slower at sticking with them. He’s got good footwork, not great. He shifts his feet well but it’s not an uncommon thing to see Lebron get off the dribble at times.

[Here Paul George beats him off the dribble. ](https://youtu.be/qyY_3_AWZrM) 

Another element of Lebron’s defense is his recoveries, if he gets beaten he often tries to erase shots from the back. “Blocked by James” haunts a lot of players and fans. His speed, leaping ability and IQ make it easy for him to run back and contest or block shots from the ball handler.

Lebron’s post defense is also great. He has the strength to bang down low, can contain players in the mid post and force and contest mid range shots. 

[Lebron uses his strength effectively to cut out Zion in the post](https://youtu.be/XmimgT867ZU) 

[Lebron is guarding Kevin Durant here. First he fronts the post, great ball denial. Then he uses his strength to keep KD in that spot, doesn't bite on the pump fake, contests the shot well to force a miss](https://youtu.be/_2C-7IhWKgs). 

When guarding bigger players like centers or power forwards, he usually fronts the post and is great at ball denial. He usually tries to swipe down at the ball when in the post. 

He isn’t able to defend deep post positioned players though, once he gives up deeper post position it’s hard for him to alter the shot, often leading to an easy shot at the basket. 

Lebron wasn’t great at navigating screens for the first half of his career, just a tendency where he had trouble moving his body around and over screens effectively. Later in his career he improved a lot and is good at staying with his man when other players are involved.

Lebron’s man defense is great, but not all time. What puts his defense at an all time level is his off ball and team defense. Lebron in his defensive prime was a master at reading and breaking up plays, making rotations. He is super active on the court, when locked in (something I’m going to touch on later) his ability to understand other team’s offenses and make sharp rotations, move around the court, offer rim protection and perimeter defense is super valuable. 

[This is a good example of his rotations. He helps off of his defense when the pass is made and AD rolls to the basket. Provides great rim protection is forces a miss from an all time finisher](https://youtu.be/sTOTT87yvBA) 

[Lebron helps off the point guard when Dwight gets the ball, he makes a great play by blocking the shot right at the rim](https://youtu.be/XUTqvE1yrvQ)

[Lebron comes in from the weakside to deny Dwight Howard. ](https://youtu.be/XUTqvE1yrvQ) 

Lebron’s off ball and team defense is easily his best defensive attribute and that’s where a large amount of his defensive impact comes from. Often Lebron played the free safety role, helping off of his matchup to slide over to the roll man, or protect the rim or attempt a steal in the passing lane. 

[This iconic play is a great example of Lebron's ability. His rotation is on time and he offers great rim resistance here. He made these type of plays often in his prime](https://youtu.be/WU-ZZPoqQKQ) 

Lebron is extremely active on the defensive end, switching through multiple positions, rotating over to stop the rim roller, closing out shooters all on the same play. 

His playmaking and vision help him in reading plays, often anticipating which pass is going to be made ahead of time. He is amazing at knowing the ball handlers passes making rotations ahead of time often breaking up plays. Rotating over to players, helping and getting blocks from the weak side, disrupting passing lanes, Lebron is great at all of these components. He’s at the right place at the right time and adds a lot of value to his team’s defense. The Miami Heat had a hard hedging defensive scheme due to Lebron’s ability to play the free safety role. Helping when the roller got the ball on a pick and roll, coming over to stop a driver, closing out a shooter on the opposite side of the court, Peak defensive Lebron did it all. 

[Lebron reads the ball handlers pass way ahead of time and gets the steal. Fantastic anticipation, his all time vision helps him here ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DXAJM14riA)

[His vision here too helps him a lot. Sees the pass ahead of time and makes a fantastic read.](https://youtu.be/b5MZltGD6gk) 

[Lebron's lightning quick reaction and anticipation](https://youtu.be/MmERtgPpxn0) 

Lebron is one of the very best in NBA history at playing off ball defense, he has value as a rim protector too. In Miami he played closer to the basket at the power forward position a fair bit, his ability to influence shots at the basket was really helpful in the “small ball” lineups they played. 

Another big reason for Lebron being an all time defender is his versatility. Lebron can guard 1-4. I wouldn’t say it’s fair to say that he can guard 1-5, but he can sure switch 1-5. You’d often see him be comfortable at handling all positions. Lebron has been consistently guarding point guards through power forwards in his career and when he switches on centers, it’s not a mismatch most of the time. 

Mostly in the playoffs, having Lebron during 2009-13 meant you can have him guard the best opposing perimeter threat. He’s spent time on nearly every player, he guarded Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard in the 2013 finals. He’s spent time on Derrick Rose and David West while being the primary defender on Kevin Durant. 

In a nutshell, Lebron in his prime can guard points, shooting guards, small forwards very comfortably. Against average power forwards he does a great job relative to other players. He can contain non scoring centers, against better bigs he may make it harder for them to score. Saying he would completely stop them is a stretch though. I absolutely don’t mind Lebron guarding 1-5 for stretches, but guarding them throughout the game (1s and 5s) is something I’m not too comfortable with. 

[Here he is switched onto Jokic and uses his strength well. He contests into a miss and secures the rebound.](https://youtu.be/PEt4UAeRsME)

This versatility allowed the heat to deploy several schemes and make use of them effectively. Lebron is one of the few players in history to effectively be able to switch through all positions. 

He does struggle at times against dominant post scorers, at times the physicality is overwhelming even for him. In his prime he did a really good job vs most shifty guards, often staying with them and sliding his feet well. Guarding wings was no problem for him either.

Lebron’s weakside shot blocking ability also helps in him playing different off ball roles. He has value as a rim protector, often helping alter shots at the basket. 

He’s great at reading passing lanes, posting healthy steal and deflection numbers. His length and ability to read plays make him effective when stealing passes. 

[Lebron Steal Rate Percentile](https://imgur.com/gallery/A2X0i4d) 

Lebron doesn’t make a lot of errors in off ball situations, though he has some minor flaws. Lebron’s closeouts at times are sloppy, not the best footwork and getting beat by subtle fakes a fair few times. He misses out on a few rotations which are extremely close to the basket, being marginally late or not realizing he could make the play. 

Lebron’s transition defense has been up and down throughout his career. In his prime it was really good, he was a great transition defender. In the later end of his career, the effort reduced and his ability to track back and impact plays wasn't as common. Lebron’s speed and size make him a really effective transition defender, closing out, swatting shots or even simply slowing down attacks.

Lebron is an elite rebounder for his position and was great at not fouling.

Another important element of Lebron’s defense is his really high defensive IQ. Lebron is a walking scouting report, with so much attention to detail and time spent studying the sport he basically knows players, their tendencies, their shooting splits on different areas of the court. The guy is simply a genius. Super high IQ defender who knows when to help off of his man, knows which shooters aren’t good ball handlers; makes them uncomfortable, etc.

Heck he knows every play of other teams too, the guy is a walking playbook too. His IQ on that side of the court is so helpful, knowing where to be, when to be, what play is being run, how to play a man, this guy is prepared for basically everything.

# Defensive Career

[Lebron dPIPM](https://imgur.com/gallery/aVTS6Qu)

[Lebron rDRTG](https://imgur.com/gallery/kcS27T0) 

Lebron James has had an eventful defensive career. During 2003-07 he wasn’t a super impactful nor great defender. Around 2008 is where he started making greater strides and 2009 is the first season where his defensive potential was realized. His on ball defense was never great pre 2009 and off ball he wasn’t super aware. During 2009 he improved in all aspects. This was around his peak athleticism too. He became more versatile, a much better on ball defender and most importantly a smarter defender. After he went to Miami, he became an ever better defender. At this stage of his life he was at his athletic peak, added more weight to his frame and as explosive as ever. His crazy athleticism along with super high IQ made him one of the best defenders in the league. He was super versatile and constantly engaged. Around 2014 is the time his effort dropped a bit. He was still a great defender, his consistency was slightly lower. When he went back to Cleavland, his athleticism had declined a touch bit. Mainly his on ball defense took a slight hit due to slower feet and his off ball defense took a slight hit due to slower reactions. In 2017 he probably reached the defensive low in his career after the first major improvement in 2009. His effort greatly reduced and his foot speed was slower. His athleticism had faded a bit too. 2017-19, Lebron wasn’t a good defender by his standards. All aspects of his defensive game took a hit to some extent. A lot of this was mainly due to him “coasting” on defense or lack of effort. He got beat more often off the dribble, he wasn’t making rotations as frequently and proficiently, he struggled with shifty guards and players in general. In 2020, he is back to being a great defender. He is very clearly not in his defensive prime but added effort along with unparalleled iq makes him a really valuable defender. 

To sum his defensive career up, I think 2009-13 was his defensive prime, this is the time he was one of the greatest and most impactful wing defenders of all time. Before that period, his fundamentals, IQ and actual ability wasn’t that high and after that period his effort and athleticism had decreased. More often than not, Lebron’s defense in the postseason becomes better than his defense in the regular season, showing he clearly saves himself for when it matters most.

# [MICHAEL JORDAN](https://imgur.com/gallery/fLJwSIr) 

Michael Jordan was a 6’6, 195-215lb freak of nature. Just like Lebron he is considered one of the most athletic players ever too. MJ has a 6’11 wingspan and a ridiculous 9.75 hand length, crazy for a 6’6 player. He also has a 11.5 handspan, again ridiculous. One of the quickest reaction times and agility in nba history, Michael was really fast both in short and long distance runs. He has a crazy 48 inch vertical, one of the best ever. 

# Defensive Profile

Michael Jordan was a super energetic high risk high reward defender for the most part. One of the most athletic players of all time, he had all the tools to be an elite defender. In his younger days, he wasn’t the smartest or most polished defender, he was still a positive on that end though. As the years went on he developed into being an elite defender with his athleticism, reactions, energy and technical ability. He made the leap from being an ok defender to good one around 1987 and became elite in 88. 

In his prime, one of the best components of his defense was his man to man defense and ability to guard skilled ball handlers. His speed, reaction time and footwork made him a really effective defender when guarding isolation possessions. Often guarding the best perimeter player on the opposing team for the first half of his career, Michael had the ability to contain players, stay in front of his man and be a superb point of attack defender. 

He put his 6’6 frame to the max using every bit of his athleticism to stop penetrators, he was so quick when moving, always keeping offensive players in front of him. On the ball, he had great fundamentals; moved in his stance really well, had great footwork and his massive hands helped in navigating players. The combination of fundamentals and supreme athleticism made Jordan really difficult to beat off the dribble. He was one of the best ever at guarding players one on one. 

Michael’s error rate on one on one defensive sequences was lower than Lebron, he got blown by less and got beat less. Younger Michael did have problems with this element, often getting beat at a higher rate. Before his 88 season this was a problem.

During 1988 and onwards his ability to slow done drives was amazing, often locking up players. He was so quick to spots and he used his chest to cut out a lot of drives. Anticipating where his man would go and reacting before the move was even made. 1988-1993 he often took on the best guard, great at containing them and forcing higher turnovers and lower shooting percentages. 

His hands were really active, one of the biggest hands in NBA history. He troubled ball handlers constantly by getting under them, great stance and using his hands to disrupt their dribble. This generated a lot of steals with him often swiping at the ball. He was so effective at this, completely shutting down players at times, getting the ball in his hands like they were gloves and killing their momentum. He was also great at contesting shots with his massive wingspan and reaction time.

His ability to remove players from games was valuable, especially in the playoffs. 

Jordan’s post defense wasn’t great for the most part. 1984-90 Jordan weighed around 195-200 pounds, he wasn’t the strongest. He struggled at times with good post players and would often try and snipe the post, a risky strategy which didn’t always pay off. Gradually as he got stronger he also got smarter, not taking as many risks and using his body more effectively. Overall Jordan’s post defense was good and didn’t hurt his team that much. 

[MJ sniping the post and getting the steal. Something he did fairly often](https://youtu.be/FlEvvHIB_RM) 

In the second half of his career, he added more strength and lost some speed, he became smarter, less risk taking defender and used his strength really effectively. During the second three-peat he was slower than before and his defensive errors on ball increased, he got blown by more. Although he didn’t bleed that much value, still a great defender

Moving onto his off ball defense, Michael Jordan is one of the greatest in passing lanes, his anticipation, hands and aggressive style means he has few of the greatest steal numbers of all time. A master at creating havoc in the passing lanes, he is 3rd all time in total steals, 18th in steal percentage and 4th in steals per game. His aggression in passing lanes was great, although again a high risk high reward strategy. He had one of the best reaction time in NBA history, lightning quick reflexes and extreme speed made him great in rotations. 

[Good subtle double by MJ and his active hands lead to the steal. Great at getting steals from the passing lanes.](https://youtu.be/5BSQgMt27jU) 

[Michael tracks the shooter well and gets the steal.](https://youtu.be/LWFGWyemioI) 

He was phenomenal at denying passes, denying and stealing a post entry, not allowing post entries when guarding the ball handler, fighting over cross screens and stealing passes, Jordan had a lot of value on creating turnovers. 

With all these positives comes the negative, Michael was a big gambler (on the court obviously), he went for steals a touch bit too often. At times his mistakes led to easy baskets, although his error rate wasn’t that high. As he matured as a player, he took less risks, went for less steals and played a more conservative (a good thing) style of defense. 

[Michael attempts the steal but fails. This leads to open dunk. His high risk high reward playstyle would lead to these types of breakdowns at times. ](https://youtu.be/QYiGVTkyQoE) 

He was a really good team defender too, making accurate reads and timely rotations at a high rate. Michael consistently helped off of his man to provide help defense, his quickness and activity rate made him a really good help defender. He was a great weakside shot blocker, he was really good at helping from the weak side in general often leading to steals or blocks. 

[Michael rotates over from the weakside to swat the shot](https://youtu.be/ed8ksHoCDaE) 

His reads were accurate, although he was a little too aggressive at times, this high risk high reward strategy led to over helping at times. An evident tendency of Jordan was his super aggressive style of defense for the first 9 years of his career. Another minor flaw was he didn’t offer a lot of resistance at the basket when rotating over. Despite having a crazy vertical leap, MJ’s rim protection wasn’t super valuable, he did make the right rotations but his contests weren’t necessarily shot altering. Younger Jordan didn’t have the mass to offer good protection, older Jordan didn’t have the vertical. He wasn’t the strongest and rim rollers could easily finish over him. He shys away from contact at the rim and wasn’t reliable in these situations.

[Here his overhelping leads to the open shot.](https://youtu.be/5BSQgMt27jU) 

Relatively early into his career and in the second three-peat, the number of good rotations he made were lesser than his prime. It was clear when he was taking the gas off and conserving his energy. Around 87-92, Michael’s activity rate was phenomenally high, both on the ball and off the ball. 

Michael’s off ball activity allowed Chicago to have one of the most aggressive perimeter defenses in NBA history. Since the bulls didn’t have great rim protection, they built their scheme around Michael, Scottie and a suffocating perimeter defense. Due to their point of attack defense, aggressive helping and stealing passing lanes, the bulls had a defensive dynasty for almost a decade. 

[Jordan helps off his man and gets the steal. Great timing and help defense](https://youtu.be/yE25pJ5yZCk) 

Michael was also a versatile defender who could guard point guards, shooting guards and small forwards. His ability to guard and switch 1-3 to near perfection was really valuable to his overall impact. Throughout his career he’s guarded these positions and he’s done it really well, he’s quick enough for points and big enough for small forwards. There’s not much of a sample size where he can guard power forwards or centers. Basically you would not trust him to switch onto PFs or centers without it being a mismatch. He’s not big enough to alter their shots or make it tougher for them. He never really needed to guard 4s and 5s but switching on bigger players wasn’t ideal. 

He’s mostly spent time on guards although he is able to guard SFs with no problem. In his career he matched up with elite offensive players in Magic Johnson, Clyde Drexler, Reggie Miller, Isiah Thomas and more. This meant the bulls could almost take a player out of the game at times, Michael’s defense was so pest like he troubled ball handlers like no other. 

Michel’s steal and block numbers for a guard are insane. 

[There's only been 13 players in NBA history to have 150+ steals and a 100+ blocks in a single season. Only 2 are guards. There's only been 4 total seasons with 200+ steals and 100+ blocks, Michael did it twice.](https://imgur.com/gallery/rPX0QPX) The red points are the 86-87 and 87-88 Jordan seasons. 

Talking about a trend in all of his defensive skills, his high risk high reward playstyle. Michael’s defensive IQ wasn’t amazing a lot of times, especially when talking about unforced errors. He didn’t make that many one on one errors, missed rotations due to his inability; it was rather due to going for steals or being a little too aggressive. This isn’t to say he wasn’t a smart defender, it’s just about losing some value due to avoidable errors.

His transition defense was a bit streaky, he wasn’t super aware early on and later on his effort was reduced. In his prime he was a really effective transition defender, slowing down fastbreaks, switching onto whoever he wanted to. 

He was also an elite rebounder for guards. His foul rate was fairly high for his position throughout his career.

# Defensive Career

[Michael Jordan dPIPM](https://imgur.com/gallery/1oXniPN)

[Michael Jordan rDRTG](https://imgur.com/gallery/dA37le3) 

With all the tools to be a really good defender, Michael entered the league as a raw defender. He was a positive around 84-86 but not a good defender. Around 87, before his dpoy campaign he improved a lot in all departments of defense. Became smarter, increased effort, much better concentration, footwork and movement had improved. His defensive prime and where he truly realized was 1988-92, at this point of time he’d solidified himself as one of the best defensive guards in the league, in fact defenders in general. Michael was one of the best defenders ever for this prime, an all time one on one defender and an elite team defender. He was still making his risky plays but he was smarter. He was about 205lb during this stretch, phenomenal athleticism and on a defensive juggernaut. In 93 his defense had dipped a bit, slightly reduced effort and a bit of a dip in athleticism. He made less good rotations, his man defense was still great and he was still as versatile. After he came back from retirement, he had lost more athleticism, was slower footed and less active in passing lanes. In 95-96 and 96-97 he became one of the best guard defenders in the league again. He was much smarter and had developed a great defensive IQ by this time. His rotation activity wasn’t as frequent but it was more controlled and really valuable. In 98 he wasn't the same athletic freak he once was, he wasn’t guarding quicker guards as frequently as it wasn’t the best matchup. He was much slower relative to young Jordan, but during 96-98 he was even stronger than before. His post defense improved and he was great at using his chest to stop players. He was still a good defender but clearly not the same. In his wizards days, Jordan was a negative defender, obviously at the age of 38 and 39 it’s hard to be a good one. 

Overall he had a great dominant defensive career, with him reaching his apex around 88-92. He was an all league level defender throughout 87-97 (missing 2 years:-94&95) and he was consistently a positive on that end up till his Washington days. He became a smarter defender in the second half of his career and he was way more athletic in the first half. Consistently being an all time man defender and great team defender, Michael also had a really high motor. Just like Lebron his defense in the postseason became even better.

# Final Comparison

So after watching the film, looking at the data available, putting their defense into context, who do I think was the better or more impactful defender?

The best way to put this is I think Lebron James had the better defensive prime (08-13) and Michael Jordan had the better defensive career. I think Lebron’s prime defense is more impactful and adds more value to his team compared to Michael’s. That added off ball defense and versatility gives him a slight edge over Jordan. Michael Jordan has the better defensive career, he was as valuable to more valuable for a longer period of time. I have 08-13 Lebron beating 88-92 Michael by a hair, his combination of team and isolation defense along with amazing versatility added a lot of value to his team. Both are all time defenders, especially in their primes. Jordan’s defensive consistency stayed up till later in his career, Lebron declined earlier. Both these greats turn it up in the playoffs, predictably their defense gets better when the stakes are higher. Both of the players were a part of great league defenses and clearly had an all time impact.",mahirs7,k11s3h,969,9402,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k11s3h/who_was_a_better_defender_lebron_james_or_michael/,2020-11-25 23:51:43
Agent Bill Duffy has likely finished repaying Anthony Carter,"In 2003, point guard Anthony Carter had a $4.1M player option to rejoin the Miami Heat for the 2003-04 NBA season. This was a good deal for Carter. However, Carter's agent Bill Duffy missed the deadline to submit the contract paperwork, costing Carter his deal with the Miami Heat and allowing them space to sign Lamar Odom--who was of course traded for Shaquille O'Neal. 

Carter went on to play with the Spurs, Timberwolves, Nuggets, Knicks, and Raptors throughout his career, never earning more than $1.3M for any given season. However, Duffy agreed to repay Carter in numerous installments over the years:

>*“In the end it was a blessing,” Carter said. “I’m still getting paid from it. Everything happens for a reason and my agent was man enough to stand up and just pay me over a period of time. To this day, I’m still getting paid. I’m still getting paid until* ***2020.****”*

"Phil Jordon: The 1st Native American player in NBA history, a 6-ft-10 center who played for 7 seasons ('57-63), plus he had a big part in Wilt's 100 point game","To my knowledge, there are only 5 NBA players ever who expressed Native American ancestry during their playing days: Phil Jordon ('57-63), Bison Dele ('92-99), Cherokee Parks ('96-04), Ron Baker ('17-19), and Kyrie Irving ('12-now). *Irving joined a tribe in 2018. His mother was a Standing Rock Sioux and lived on a reservation before being adopted at a young age. She later died when Kyrie was 4 so he didn't have much of a connection to this part of his heritage for most of his life, but Kyrie and his sister Asia both joined the tribe at a naming ceremony in 2018.*

Phil Jordon was of Wailaki and Nomlaki descent. He grew up in rural Sumner, WA, and played basketball at tiny Whitworth College in Spokane, and was the 42nd overall pick in the 1956 draft by the Lakers. However, he had left Whitworth after 2 seasons and did some AAU barnstorming for a year or two before joining the NBA in 1956, with the Knicks not the Lakers. As a 6-ft-10 big man, he was a capable but un-spectacular player, with his peak years being '59-61 during which he averaged 13 ppg and 8 rpg, appearing for 3 different teams. 


From [this article](https://legacy.pressdemocrat.com/news/2213479-181/redwood-empires-forgotten-nba-big) about his life: 
> ""He was as good as most of the big men in that era, except for the real outstanding ones like Russell and Chamberlain,"" said Willie Naulls, 78, his teammate with the Knicks for two full seasons and parts of two others. ""But I think he was limited by his (early) competition. ... There wasn't very much local competition where he was growing up, as there is today. He had the physical frame and natural grace and ability to develop into a very competitive athlete.""

Unfortunately **Jordon's biggest claim to fame as a player** was for *NOT* playing in a particular game. As the Knicks' starting center in the 1961-62 season ([picture](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/Hp8AAOSwRn9dyzM9/s-l1600.png)), he reportedly drank an entire case of beer in his hotel room on March 1, 1962, before going out on the town with a teammate for more fun. The next day, Jordon was unable to play (*officially due to the flu*). Playing without their only starter taller than 6-ft-6, the already awful Knicks surrendered 100 points to opposing center Wilt Chamberlain.

Jordon's career was over after the '63 season, and tragically he died in a rafting accident in 1965 at only 31 years old.",WinesburgOhio,k1nxje,12,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k1nxje/phil_jordon_the_1st_native_american_player_in_nba/,2020-11-26 23:37:20
"Back in 2017, Kevin Durant said “His (DeRozan’s) footwork in the post is flawless... At first he was a dunker and he barely dunks now. He’s a finesse player but he can play power forward.” This past season DeMar plays majority of his mins at PF and ends up having his most efficient season","DeMar played a guard/wing most career. In 2017 he was playing mostly the SG position. Kevin Durant in a [comment on DeMar](https://torontosun.com/2017/02/17/durant-a-big-admirer-of-derozan-and-his-work-ethic/wcm/72452313-f2c8-4777-a106-dc3c847647b2) goes on to say the following,

> “**His footwork in the post is flawless. His jump shot in the mid-range is incredible. That is the type of stuff I look at as a basketball guy, his footwork, his mechanics on his J, his handle. At first he was a dunker and he barely dunks now. He’s a finesse player but he can play power forward. I’m a big fan**”

This was 3 years ago before anyone had really tried DeMar at the 4 for any significant mins. Even though if you look at DeMar post scoring numbers that year, [at PPP 1.13 and eFG% of 52%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/playtype-post-up/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&PerMode=Totals&CF=POSS*GE*150&sort=PPP&dir=1&SeasonYear=2016-17), he was the league most efficient scoring in the post. 

This past season, Popovic decides that he wants to play him at PF position for majority of his mins, and the result - he not only had his most efficient season but also one of the more efficient players in the league. 

In his 5 season prior his highest TS% was his 2018/19 at 55.%
Last year he [shot 60.3%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/derozde01.html). That’s a very significant jump. 

Also be noted that Pop is playing him a lot like a Point Forward. He is a better facilitator and dishing more dimes than any season in the past. 

As 6’6” and 220lbs he still quite small for the 4, so it will be interesting to see how he does long term. Perhaps he can put some weight and bulk up a bit. Also as age starts to creep and he loses his athleticism, he can prolong his career as he relies more in his footwork than the explosive step. Those who have watched him play over the years, already notice how he has evolved more into old man Paul Pierce style of play in the paint, compared to his earlier days that resembled more of Corey Maggette.",Spurer,k141n0,214,2980,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k141n0/back_in_2017_kevin_durant_said_his_derozans/,2020-11-26 01:51:30
[Sports Illustrated] Dwight Howard Calls Sixers' Ben Simmons a Young LeBron James,"https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/dwight-howard-sixers-ben-simmons-young-lebron-james

>With everything he knows about LeBron James -- Howard is qualified to make comparisons to the future Hall of Famer. And the newest member of the Philadelphia 76ers believes the team employs somebody whose game is quite similar.

>On Wednesday, Dwight Howard met with the Philly media virtually for the first time since signing with the team late last week. Although Howard sang praises for both of the Sixers' young All-Stars, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons -- it was Simmons who received a comparison to one of the greatest players the NBA has ever seen. 

>“Ben Simmons is a young LeBron who’s developing an overall game,"" Howard explained. ""I love the way he plays; I love how unselfish he is, and how mean he can be to other teams, and that’s important. When you have your point guard coming down, dunking on people, flexing, getting big rebounds, talking trash, doing all those things, it drives you to want to be better.”

>[...]

>“Watching him over the years, I see it,” Howard claimed in regards to Simmons. “He has an opportunity to be one of the greatest to ever play the game, and I’m glad I have the opportunity to actually give him some things that can help him along the way.”

Dwight joined the Lakers and he played with Bron so he knows what his playstyle is like. Is Dwight jumping the gun on the LeBron comparison or is he correct in his assessment?

Knicks had a suprisingly great offseason thus far and I am dangerously excited for this team's future.,"First, I am not a reliable or objective guy. I called Knox ""Antetokounmpo Lite"" when we drafted him lmao but I am excited about our future now, never been this excited about the Knicks since Linsanity.

1- **Ed Davis moves**. We got 3 second rounds and two young (not saying good, but young) players for only $7M of cap space.

2- **Draft night moves**. Traded up to 23 with 28 and 37, and traded down to 25 and 33, and than traded the 33rd pick for a 2023 second rounder, which will probably be the double draft. Quickley was projected to go later and we still had another (better?) options like RJ Hampton, Tyrell Terry, Theo Maledon etc. but it is understandable because of the Kentucky connections.

3- **Not overpaying anyone in FA**. We didn't pursue VanVleet, we didn't offer Hayward more than 3/70 and we didn't do stupid panicking moves like giving Wayne Ellington $8M a year with a team option or giving Julius Randle $18M a year becauce he was the best player who wanted to go to Knicks. We signed Burks, Rivers, Noel, Payton and Myles Powell. All of them are good moves except Payton and they all have flippable contracts at the trade deadline.

4- **Not trading for a big contract, especially Chris Paul**. A CAA client who wanted to play for the Knicks and also wanted by the fans. Steve Mills would trade for him and would give Frank, Mitch, Knox and 2 first rounds lmao. We made offers to CP3 and Westbrook, we tried to trade for them for a reasonable price, they didn't accept it and we didn't improve our offer.

5- **Signals of a total rebuild**. The next 3 drafts are stacked and we're trying to get enough picks to reconstruct the team from the start. We have 13 picks and a pick swap in the next 3 drafts. Also, it means that if the lottery fucks us again, we can trade up this time.

6- **Hirings**. Walt Perrin, who was the head scout of Utah for years and the man who chose Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Gordon Hayward and a lot more. Darren Erman, who was the assistant coach in NOLA, GSW, BOS and was the G-League coach of Boston's team last year. Insane development guy, especially in D. Frank Zanin, who was an assistant GM in OKC(He worked under Sam Presti.) and BKN in the Billy King Era and was a candidate to be the new GM of BKN and a lot more. It seems like we're so much into development.

7- **Taking cap dumps for picks**. They were going to sign Austin Rivers, but they decided to do a sign and trade yesterday and that means that Rose will try to take a cap dump for picks, which is likely to be Nic Batum. It was a neccesary move.

8- **Dolan not doing anything**. After the Spike events and the firing of Steve Mills, Dolan decided not to interfere anything Knicks related. He is just taking his paycheck and playing his shitty songs on his guitar. Leave him alone, please.

We still made some mistakes like giving Payton an another contract, still keeping Scott Perry around etc. but it might be the greatest Knicks offseason I've ever seen in years. You can't start to win in one offseason and we're bad for a long time, it'll take some time to recover.",RevaltOfGiria,k1h63g,102,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k1h63g/knicks_had_a_suprisingly_great_offseason_thus_far/,2020-11-26 17:31:47
[OC] The Charlotte Hornets do no know what they are doing,"Ok, the Hornets not knowing what they're doing might not be *original content*, but bear wtih me. 

The Hornets want to sign Gordon Hayward to a 4 year, $120M deal. My opinion on this deal has absolutely no bearing on this post; for all intents and purposes let's call it a good deal. 

The Hornets have **$89M** of cap locked-in to: Graham, Ball, Rozier, Monk, Martin twins, McDaniels, Bridges, Batum, Washington, and Zeller.

The salary cap is **$109M**. For Hayward to get $120M/4, he needs to start at **$28M**. ***That means the Hornets need to create $8M more in cap room.*** To do that, they have 3 options:

1. Stretch Nic Batum. **DO NOT DO THIS.** Waiving Batum allows them to sign Hayward, but creates $10M of excess cap room that they won't get to use this season. He'll be $9M of dead cap on their books for the next 3 years, and that actually matters when you start thinking about their upcoming rookie extensions.

2. Trade Batum for a smaller contract that allows them to create the $8M needed for Hayward. Here's what shows Charlotte's incompetence: now teams all know they're signing Hayward, so they can hold Charlotte over a barrel if they actually want to do this. Charlotte can try to convince Boston to give up assets to help them trade Batum and do a S&T to create a trade exception for them, but I doubt Boston would give up enough to help anyone take Batum, so this option is unlikely.

3. **Stretch Cody Zeller**. This is what Charlotte should do. Waiving him creates $10M in cap room, just what they need to fit Hayward in. I like Cody Zeller but he's a replaceable below-average center. They could've waived him and signed Whiteside and Dedmon. Now because they got caught with their thumbs up their ass they lost Whiteside and other quality cheap centers, but they should still do this and grab Dedmon/Gibson/Tolliver.

All this shows Charlotte was completely unprepared for this offseason. What do you think?",FlameOfWar,k1ibam,77,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k1ibam/oc_the_charlotte_hornets_do_no_know_what_they_are/,2020-11-26 18:34:09
The Ballad of Paul Millsap: How a second round pick became The Anchorman,"When Paul Millsap came out of the draft, he was told he'd be too small to be a successful NBA player at the 4, that his lack of size and speed would mean he'd never become a good NBA player, that he'd, at best, be Mailk Rose (a guy who only averaged 6 points in his career, though he did win 2 titles and is apparently one of the top GMs in the G-League). Fast forward to 2020, Paul is a 4 time All-Star, has been on an all-defensive team, and was arguably the leading member of a 60 win hawks team, and is currently the defensive anchor on a Nuggets team that just made the WCF.

Coming out of Louisiana Tech, Paul led the NCAA in rebounds for 3 straight years, was a 2 time member of the All-WAC teams, and averaged over 18 points throughout his college career, and yet he was still a 2nd round draft pick.

In his first two years with the Jazz, Paul only started 3 games, but was still a member of the All-Rookie 2nd team, but seemingly had already stagnated after his 2nd year, something that really wasn't deemed a surprise for a guy who was only a 2nd round pick.

Then year 3 happened. Unleashed by the Jazz, Paul hit double-digit points for the first time in his career, something that he has yet to drop from despite recently turning 35. A guy who was told he'd never ""rebound with the big boys"" started to average 8 rebounds per game. His 4th year wasn't anything special, he started less games, played less minutes, and scored less points, but peaking at 14 ppg with good defensive in his 3rd year is something that almost any second round pick would ask for.

But he didn't stop there, finally being transitioned into a starter in his 5th year, Paul averaged over 17 PPG, 7.6 RPG, and over 2 APG, something that doesn't seem amazing now, but for a big back in the early 2010s was kinda out of the ordinary.

His last two years with the Jazz kinda dropped off from his great year 5, but he definitely was something special for a guy who was drafted at 47.

Then, in 2013, Paul signed with the Hawks. He wasn't supposed to be much more than a good defensive player, but he formed an excellent big-man duo with Al Horford, and became an All-Star. Was it in a weak East, yes, but an All-Star appearance is still an All-Star appearance, and his 4 put him over some of the other more notable recent 2nd round stars Draymond and Isaiah Thomas, who made 3 and 2 All-Star games respectively. While with the Hawks, Paul averaged 17 PPG, 8 RPG, and over 3 APG, with great defense on a team that was consistently good for his 4 years there. After his 4 year stint with the Hawks, he signed with the Nuggets on an extremely big contract to be a good defensive player for them. Something that he has absolutely achieved. While he's gotten worse with age, Paul still provides a solid 10 points with 5 rebounds, and a good amount of threes. Something thought unimaginable because they never thought he'd develop a three-point shot when he came out of college.

Is Paul Millsap a flashy player? No. Was Paul Millsap ever a star, debatable? Hall Of Fame? No. Will he be remembered once he retires beyond Hawks and Jazz fans, who knows? But Millsap was a trend-setter, one of the first good modern Small Power Forwards, who knows how the modern PF position would've developed with out him. Paul Millsap may have only made his All-Star games because of being in a weak conference, he may have been on the worst 60 win team ever, but he still managed to become one of the biggest over-achievers in modern basketball. A guy who was told that he wasn't athletic or big enough to be any more than Mailk Rose became one of the prototypes for what his position is today. 

This is the Ballad of Paul Millsap. The song of a man who was never supposed to be great spitting in the face of positional norms, quietly becoming a prototype for the modern Power Forward, and looking [damn good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCiHOpNJXnc) while doing it. On this Thanksgiving, I just want to say that I'm thankful for the Anchorman.

Lots of players were close, usually missing 1 or 2 categories but Kareem is the only one I could find to have led the league in both offense and defensive advanced statistics. 

Here are some players who were close, and to no surprise they are all all great two-way players. 

**Wilt Chamberlain**

-There were no BPM data from players from Wilt's era, but he wouldn't have accomplished this anyways since Bill Russell almost always led the league in DWS, and the season where he did lead in DWS, he didn't lead in OWS. 

**Michael Jordan** 

-MJ led the league in most advanced categories throughout his prime, but only led in DBPM twice and never in DWS where he was top 5 a couple years. 

**LeBron James**

-LeBron was in a similar case to Jordan where he was very close, falling short in the defensive stats. He never led the league in DWS but did lead in DBPM in 2011-12. He was runner up/top 5 several times throughout his prime as well.

* These guys are duplicates. So the real life KD / Harden / Westbrook / Ibaka are still on the Nets, Rockets, Clippers.
* That said, we're imagining that we're doing this today. KD is still 32 and coming back from injury. Harden is still 31, and this time around the guys will have a better understanding of his MVP-level abilities. Any beef between KD and Westbrook still exists.
* Their coach is still Scotty Brooks, but Derek Fisher and Nick Collison can take more active roles on the bench if they like.

So what do you guys say? Should we get the gang back together? Can they make a run?

"Who had the better team around them last season: Jimmy, Harden, or Giannis?","How would you rank the help these players had last season? No question the biggest name on these supporting casts was Russ. However, he really struggled and the Rockets had a massive deficiency at the center spot. They basically had to ball out every night to outscore their opponents because they were guaranteed to give up some real points in the paint.

Giannis' team featured another allstar scorer in Middleton and a fantastic rim protector in Brook. Bledsoe was meh, and they struggled finding a competent player to run the offense outside of Giannis.

There's certainly some recency bias, but the Heat supporting cast looks really good here. Shooters in Herro and Robinson. An all star caliber PG in Dragic and a two-way big man in Bam. Playing Herro and Robinson opens up some weakness on perimeter defense, but overall this is a well-rounded group.",chivestheconquerer,k1lk61,34,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k1lk61/who_had_the_better_team_around_them_last_season/,2020-11-26 21:22:21

> Gasol addressed the media for the first time as a member of his new team on Wednesday and spoke highly of his time in Toronto.

>“I’m going to miss Toronto,” Gasol told reporters on a video conference call. “Toronto, it’s been a great place. My family was very settled there. Very comfortable. … That’s just the way, sadly, this business goes but I thought my run in Toronto could not get better.”

>The 35-year-old’s production took a slight dip in 2019-20 and his playing time decreased in the post-season, however the Raptors were reportedly still interested in re-signing him.

>“I wasn’t sure I was going to be able to be the player that they needed me to be there in order to win (another ring),” Gasol explained. “I thought the right thing to do for me was to join the Lakers and contribute to what they’ve got going on.”

>[...]

> “For me, the most important thing was how I was going to fit on the court and how I was going to be able to help the team,” Gasol added.

Marc Gasol felt like he wouldn't be able to perform for the Raptors to the best of his ability and I do agree that maybe it was best both parties moved on. He can definitely help the Lakers more than the Raptors right now. I really think he will be happy in LA and secure another title. Happy for the guy and wish him all the best - class act all around.

I’ve always kind of thought of it that a head coach’s impact is like, game to game strategy with line ups and general play calling as the head coach’s impact on their team.

Obviously there’s more to it then that, but I don’t know how to evaluate it. Similarly, I don’t know how teammate impacts a young player more than say, calling a play to get the ball to them. Also hyping up your boy. But that’s more or less because that’s the only aspect I really see.

"LeBron's Playoff Experience In Perspective (3 extra seasons, Game 7s, Total Game count, etc.)","TLDR: LeBron has played over 3 extra NBA seasons from his post-season games alone, putting him over \~20 equivalent NBA seasons already.  He is going into his 4th prime, and even if he slows down the Lakers are still situated to compete in at least 2-3 more playoffs to come, likely putting his total playoff game total at around 4-5 extra NBA seasons in raw games.

&#x200B;

**PART I: ""Prince James"" (2006-2010) - 39-29 Record, 68 Total Games**.  0 NBA Championships, 1 Finals Appearance, 2 Conference Finals Appearances

They won 8 playoff series and were 0-2 in Game 7's.  They swept 3 teams (Wizards in 2007, Hawks and Pistons in 2009), and were swept once (Spurs in 2007)

&#x200B;

**PART II: ""South Beach King"" (2011-2014) - 59-28 Record, 87 Total Games.**  2 NBA Championships, 4 Finals Appearances, 4 Conference Finals Appearances

They won 14 playoff series and were 3-0 in Game 7's.  They swept 2 teams (Bucks in 2013, Bobcats in 2014), and were never swept.

&#x200B;

**PART III:  ""Redemption King"" (2015-2018) - 55-26 Record, 81 Total Games.** 1 NBA Championship, 4 Finals Appearances, 4 Conference Finals Appearances

They won 13 playoff series and were 3-0 in Game 7's.  They swept 7 teams (Raptors x 2, Hawks x 2, Pacers, Pistons and Celtics), and they were swept once (GSW in 2018)

In Conclusion: He's played 260 post season games, which is about 3.2 extra seasons.  So even though he's going into his 18th season, he's played the equivalent of around 20-21 seasons NBA seasons already with post-season play.  He hasn't lost a game 7 since 2008.  He's never lost in the 1st round.

"In this time of runaway-train levels of optimism, who do you think will be the worst 5 teams in the NBA next year?","The thing about this kind of year is that everyone assumes the best for their team.  Young guys will improve.  Older guys will hang on one more year.  Bad shooting seasons were a fluke.  Good shooting years represent true improvement.  But we know that this optimism can’t be true for every team.   What 5 teams do you think will be worst this year?  Here are mine in no particular order. 

New York Knicks

The Knicks are finally taking their medicine!   No bad FA signings is super encouraging to see. Perhaps coaching can take them out of the dregs, but I just don’t think they have the talent to be meaningfully better than last season.  Hope to see good things from Toppin and Barrett. 

Cleveland Cavaliers 

Their defense will likely be horrible.  Their offense shouldn’t be enough to overcome it. A leap in Sexton’s playmaking could change things. 

Oklahoma City Thunder

I love the Thunder.  Presti is the GOAT.  They liquidated all their talent though and I can’t imagine it’ll be great for morale this season.  Maybe Horford has a resurgent year and Poku takes the leap?  I think it’s a safer bet that they’re pretty bad. 

Charlotte Hornets 

They have some good players, but empowering a rookie PG is the quickest route to the top of the lottery.  They also vastly outperformed their point differential last season.  This is unlikely to persist.  Hopefully Graham’s first half of last season was more representative than his second. 

Detroit Pistons

If they empower Hayes they could have a similar problem to Charlotte.  Blake could drag them to competency but I don’t know if his body can do it anymore.  Playing him in the playoffs was absolutely reprehensible.  

Sleeper pick: Orlando Magic

The Magic are begging for a rebuild.  I know Vucevic and Fournier can drag them to the 10th seed effortlessly, but I felt Augustin was an important element of the regular season formula. I hope they deal those guys at the deadline and finally choose a direction.

Signing Gordon Hayward is just a continuation of MJ and the Hornets constantly pursuing March Madness stars,"Gordon Hayward has been targeted by the Hornets since 2014 so it got me thinking, why are the Hornets so buzzed about him?

In 2011, the Hornets drafted Kemba Walker, March Madness star and NCAA champion. They later paired him up with his former teammate Jeremy Lamb who helped Kemba and UCONN win a title.

In 2012, they went with MKG,who was the consensus pick but also coming off a NCAA title run.

In 2013 and 2014, they went BPA with Zeller and Vonleh

In 2015, MJ drafted Frank Kaminsky which was a bit of a reach but it makes sense considering he just had a great March Madness run and a storied NCAA career.

2016-2019 Hornets drafted Malachi Richardson, Malik Monk, and Miles Bridges. No real connection there

2020 no March Madness so Hornets pick Lamelo Ball

"The advanced statistic ""passer rating"" is based off Ben Taylor manually scoring seasons by his own criteria from 1-10, then regressing on that to find coefficients","Passing Rating is becoming a more widely used advanced statistic by people in the NBA analytics community and some r/NBA posters. It's basically a scoring from 1-10 of a player's overall proficiency in passing. 

I decided to spend like 10-15 minutes looking at how it is calculated, and I have to say, it's not very impressive : https://backpicks.com/2018/07/15/nba-passer-ratings-since-1978/

It's basically just Ben Taylor manually scoring a 100 seasons, then running some type of regression on that. For those who don't care about ML, this is basically just the same as saying he found the coefficients that when multiplied by some available box score statistics(Turnovers, Assist to Load Ratio, Height(?)), result in the manual scoring that he did.

So essentially the entire formula for passer rating is dependent on how accurately you think one guy's manual rating on 1-10 for passing ability is. 

This isn't to hate on Ben Taylor as I cite him frequently. It seems like a fun exercise, but its not exactly be-all end-all",rfedthegoat,k170n1,42,87,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k170n1/the_advanced_statistic_passer_rating_is_based_off/,2020-11-26 05:00:03

 2. There is not enough cap space to sign AD Lebron and Giannis. The Lakers are short like 8-10m and it’s very unlikely that Lebron would be willing to take a haircut to sign Giannis. He has almost a perfect legacy and doesn’t want Heatles vibes in his final stretch

Are we as devoted and highly invested fans of the sport becoming a little too obsessed with roster changes?,"Now don't get me wrong, the GM side of the sport is invaluable and, besides the star players themselves , is probably the factor which most  strongly dictates who the dominant teams are. I'm just beginning to think that people are starting to become too singulary focused on the arms race when natural progression of current players often times can just far outweigh roster movement, real or proposed. 

This is only natural as fans and evenmore so in the digital social media age and the increased empowerment of players in our day. I myself have definitely spent a lot of time over the years fantasizing about trades and draft selections as a pasttime. 

For example the big talk in the eastern conference right now are the Celtics and Bucks(and the Nets and raptors) offseason changes. However, honestly I could see the Celtics getting over the ECF hump simply if Brown and Tatum both make the kind of modest improvements you could reasonably expect out of two extremely young uber athletic all star wings. Like honestly it was the Celtics' vets who let him down. If Brown and Tatum played the same they did but Hayward and Kemba played better it could have easily been Celtics in 6 or 7, remember the Celtics(and Bucks) blew 16-17+ point leads LATE into the game multiple times against the Heat, including that super close overtime game that Bam blocked Tatum. I could easily see Kemba and Hayward returning to their former selves this year, or at the very least put up much better showings in the big playoff games. Outside of Tatum and Brown the Celtics are the youngest team in the league with many many youngsters who project as fantastic role players and they just need a few to pan out. 

Same for the Bucks, now losing Matthews hurts no doubt and getting Jrue is an incredible boon, but what about the progression of their 25 year gym rat MVP gym rat?  Seriously, has there ever been a combination of natural physical gifts with dedication to the game like Giannis? He is definitively the most impactful player in the conference even with Tatum and Siakam getting better as well and besides just outside shooting can stand to improve his passing variety and versatility, arsenal of back to basket moves and footwork, and overall feel for the game on both ends. Bucks should also expect to see Donte Divencenzo take a bigger role and honestly he has the potential to eventually become an even better version of Alex Caruso.

&#x200B;

As a Bay Area kid and Warriors lover I absolutely love the moves we have made for over a year now and honestly think we are a serious threat to resume the dynasty even with the devastating Klay news. I love everything about D'angelo Russell, he's up there with Brandon Jennings with me as far as most aesthetically pleasing players to watch. I just don't think he's that much of a winner, and also his skills overlap too much with Steph, DLo is an amazing shooter and very good nifty passer but Steph is just as good of a passer and obviously the GOAT shooter. Steph also better at scoring at the rim and defense despite D'lo being taller and much much longer. 

Speaking of length the Warriors have absurd length now. Wiggins, Draymond, Oubre, and Paschall are all 6'7ish wings with massive 7'1-7'3 wingspans, huge hands, and 3 out of 4 of those guys are young and uber athletic while the 4th is one of the greatest defensive masterminds ever. Now throw in the 7'1 unicorn with a 7'6 wingspan in James Wiseman and I would wager that this version of the dubs will be by far the best rebounding edition, and also after some time of marinating and development will eventually become the best defensive version too.  If I did not scare you fans of other Western Conference contenders even a little just now than you are being foolhardy at your own risk.

Now with all that being said, I have been obsessing over the potential of Wiggins and Oubre and Wiseman and poring over the small details with my fellow warriors fans like if we are cutting JTA and the signing of Brad Wanamaker. When in reality the difference between the dubs returning to the finals stage or getting completely outclassed in the second round could be how Steph and Draymond come out. Steph in 2016 was in my opinion the best offensive season ever and if he is even 80-85% as good this year I think that singlehandedly puts us in contention and guys like Oubre and Wiggins will have career years just from the defense getting utterly warped by the skyfucker. 

Same with Draymond Green, I myself constantly forget and have to remind myself just how special this motherfucker is and I should be ashamed of ever even contemplating trading him. Now I know offseason workout clips never mean shit but this year with Draymond im optimistic because for him its more about being in good physical condition than it is about handles or whatever. He's cut the hot cheetos and has been grinding the strength and conditioning getting shredded and as for the shot, Warriors fans have been saying its cause of his hips tightening up the years my man should get on some hot stone yoga and do some pelvic openers or some shit. And lastly, guys like Poole and Paschall and Smiley are getting better same with Looney and Chriss who I think by playoff time along with Wiseman will make one of the best center rotations in the league.

 

I think this tendency is just borne out of us being devoted fans who have no control over our beloved team's success so we love to play GM to try and create a sense of control and just for enjoyment.

I went to college in the midwest and there were kids from all over, my friends from Houston or New York(lol) would obsess over the smallest insignificant roster changes but I mean cant blame them I would do the same.

I feel like it has some overlap with the similar issue of fans wanting teams to immediately blow it up and rebuild when they aren't contenders. I think it was Danny Ainge who said only 1 out of 30 teams can win the title every year. You can take that further only 2 out of 30 can make the finals and only 4 out of 30 the conference finals. Throw in the fact that the NBA has best of 7 series and basketball is a super high scoring game, there is much less variance in terms of the best teams not making the finals compared to the other major leagues. So do not take being a regular playoff presence for granted. I feel like being a 5-10 seed in this league is barely seen as better than being a bottom team. But I think theres still value in being a consistent solid team, even if you never make the finals. For example Portland fans and Dame Lillard, who is one of the best scoring point guards and outside off the dribble shooters ever, just overshadowed by the great Steph Curry. I think Portland fans are still very grateful for him and he will forever be a legend in the Rose City even if he never makes the finals or even returns to the conference finals.",ShakeMilton,k1dqjf,19,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k1dqjf/are_we_as_devoted_and_highly_invested_fans_of_the/,2020-11-26 13:34:19
Media’s treatment of the Knicks is unfair,"I’ll start this off by saying yes, I am a Knicks fan and I know the Knicks have been consistently a dumpster fire of a franchise for years. I know this but what I’m saying is the hypocrisy of every post season. When we sign or trade for aging m vets on giant contracts (Westbrook, Hayward) to try and win now instead of developing youth. We get made fun of (rightfully so) and get lolknicked. Hahaha Knicks making the same dumb moves again 😂. But when we fill the team out with decent role players and choose to focus on developing our youth. The media and NBA twitter frames it as us missing out on Westbrook and Gordon Hayward. Trolling us saying the Knicks wanted Westbrook and Gordon Hayward and got Austin rivers and Nerlons Noel instead. Through the whole offseason and draft, people were making fun of us for the thought of trading young pieces for Westbrook and making same old Knicks moves but now immediately after us not getting those guys it’s lol Knicks wanted these players and got worse players instead. I may just be ranting but it’s kinda annoying. We’re finally rebuilding the proper way and we can’t even do that without getting fan and media hate. I get people are probably just doing it because hating on Knicks is cool and easy to get attention and likes but it doesn’t sit well with me.

EDIT: 
So far the arguments against what I’m saying is: 

1. You have to start winning for us to not trash you guys: 

There a multiple teams in just as worse positioning for the same amount of time as well as bad front offices that don’t get a quarter of the jokes we get

2. You guys do it too by expecting big stars:

This is not accurate every year ESPN, CBS, Fox sports and big media inserts Top free agent player going to Knicks and when it dosent happen we get clowned for rumors and stories we didn’t even create. Most Knicks fans didn’t even WANT Westbrook yet we’re getting clowned. 

3. Knicks fans get unfair treatment by the Knicks: 

Duh!! Everyone knows that!😭does it even have to be said. How does it effect my argument

4. Your in NY. It comes with the territory of a large sports media:

This leaves the Pistons with 18 players on the team right now, 21 if you go off of ESPN's depth chart or roster, which claim they have retained Henson, Knight, and McRae, or 22 if you include Wikipedia and a few minor newspaper's claims that King is still a Piston.

> ""The additions of Ibaka and Luke Kennard (via trade with Detroit) are just the beginning; many rival teams also expect the Clippers to trade Lou Williams in their quest to create a fresh-start environment after they blew a 3-1 series lead to the Nuggets,"" wrote Stein.


The Clippers had reportedly explored a trade for Terry Rozier with an aim to upgrade the point guard position.

Is Corey Brewer the worst player in NBA history to score 50 or more points in one game?,"Corey Brewer scored a career high 51 point for the Wolves in a 112-110 win over the Rockets on April 11, 2014.

In addition to the 51 points, Brewer had 2 rebounds, 1 assist & 6 steals in 44 mins.

Brewer shot 19/30 (63%) from the floor including 2/6 from the three point line & 11/15 from the free throw line.

After winning back-to-back national titles at the University of Florida, Minnesota selected Brewer with the 7th pick in the 2007 NBA Draft.

Brewer played for Wolves, Rockets, Nuggets, Lakers, Kings, Thunder, Mavs, & 76ers during his 13 year NBA career.  Brewer won a championship in 2011 with Dallas.

Brewer's career averages are 9 points, 2 rebounds & 1 assist with a shooting split of 42/28/71.

Brewer started in all 82 games for the Wolves in 2010 & averaged a career high 13 points with a shooting split of 43/34/64.

Brewer retired in 2020 with $53 million in career earnings.

Brewer was recently hired by Stan van Gundy to be a player development coach for the Pelicans.

Analytics in relation to personality (opinion),"I feel the most overlooked aspect of NBA players has become who they are as a human being. I think this is why we've seen so many teams loaded with talent become busts over the last few years. For example this year's clippers, the kyrie Celtics, all Westbrooke era thunder, Jimmy Butler 76ers, LeBron and all rookie lakers. Yes all teams had many visible problems but i feel like the underlying issue was the team chemistry between stars with other stars and stars with role players.

I'm wondering why teams gm's haven't put as much insight into matching personalities along with analytics. I also see how this creates championship teams that hate each other by the time the play offs are over, as in the big 3 celtics, Durant era thunder, kyries departure, and all the way back to Shaq and kobe. 

I feel this will come into play even more as the nba trys to mix the older generation in with the younger. Compare any 18 and 28 year old you know and try to imagine making them work together. This isn't a knock on any generation its more of a observation that both have lived completely different lifestyles to no fault of their own.

On this Thanksgiving 🦃 I wonder if r/nba can come up with a new NBA.,"I've been thinking about a new idea for the NBA and it was a mashup of ideas I've seen posted on this sub. So I wanted to share it and see if we all can add and edit and come up with a hypothetical New NBA structure that can lead to more fun. 


Here's the gist. 

First the NBA expands to 2 new cities. We know them we've all seen the post. Seattle and Vegas. Seattle is self explanatory and Vegas opens the NBA to gambling and more revenue stream. Now that does cut into Lakers fans but I think there are enough of those already.

Second move Minnesota to the east and create 2 new conferences. I was thinking Atlantic and Pacific but we can keep it simple with just East and West. Under that we can have 4 division with 8 teams each. I saw a post earlier with great names but I can't remember so someone post it. 


Now that we have our foundation. Let's add some fun. A Mid summer tournament. The Michael Jordan invitational.
Top 4 teams currently from each division square up. 1 game tournament of the best current teams. Winner gets Playoff Guarantee, Home court Guarantee, maybe bye week. There can be a Jordan best tournament player award. Win or lose. This should happen right before All Star game. And might lead to more new all star appearances. This should happen before March madness to NBA can go on break after All Star. Before the tournament of course NFL Superbowl just ended so no competition. 

Here's the thing. The MJI mid summer tourney is the first time East and West Play each other. Before it's closed conference. After the mid summer the conferences open up. But I don't see the east playing west More than 1 or 2 games. And big matchups. Before it's Closed Conference season. This will lead to More division and conference pride for championships. Division champs get Autoplayoffs auto top 4. Playoffs is top8 each conferences by records. Except division champs. Even tourney winner could be 8 seed but they get Home court for winning the tourney. 

Playoffs should stay 7 games imo. And all star game should stay Kobe Style. 

I dont know what the schedule would look like but that's what I got. What do you guys think. Please no jokes unless it's Gold worthy, I actually wanna build something. Cause NBA gets boring sometimes. And can get better.",ChampiongodFlow,k1pqo1,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k1pqo1/on_this_thanksgiving_i_wonder_if_rnba_can_come_up/,2020-11-27 01:21:57
"Hey, here's a ridiculous LeBron statistic","1) Basketball-Reference started tracking ""And-1s"" and shots blocked in the 1996-97 season. Since that time, I'm pretty sure LeBron is the all-time leader in And-1s with 1,254. That's impressive, but not terribly shocking -- only Malone and Kareem have more career points than him, and they played a lot of their career/all of their career before 96-97.

2) Here's the ridiculous part: LeBron has only had his shot blocked 933 times in his career. Out of all the players I've looked at, I've been able to find exactly one player with more career and-1s than shots blocked: Shaq, who had 1,093 And-1s and 546 shots blocked. (Note: He did play four seasons before and-1s and shots blocked were being tracked, so he probably has more and-1s than LeBron.)

In no particular order, here are those numbers alongside everyone else that I can think of's And-1/Shots blocked numbers (an asterisk by the name means they played seasons before 96-97):

LeBron: 1,254/933

Shaq\*: 1,093/546

Kevin Durant: 531/552

Giannis: 414/483

Harden: 517/897

Kobe: 846/1,156

Jordan\*: 168/225

Karl Malone\*: 450/541

DeAndre Jordan: 283/296

Steph Curry: 238/378

Vince Carter: 457/768

Anthony Davis: 396/408

Andre Drummond: 257/501

Kawhi: 243/281

Carmelo: 619/1,360

Al Jefferson: 435/886

Kyrie Irving: 238/476

The Thunder have close to $65 million in trade exceptions through November 2021.,"Just a hunch but I don't think Sam Presti's anywhere close to done yet with regards to trades and transactions. All that space to absorb contracts and accommodate multi-team trades is going to be huge especially at the trade deadline as teams either try to unload bad contracts to clear cap space for the summer of 2021, try to get under the luxury tax line, or need help moving salary trying to acquire a key player heading into playoffs.

It's kinda crazy how Presti's navigated OKC from a cash-strapped luxury tax-hole team to probably the most flexible a team's ever been in NBA history, in a matter of two years. Russell Westbrook's contract was supposed to be a problem, Steven Adams/Dennis Schroder's contracts were supposed to be a problem, Chris Paul's contract was supposed to be a problem -- he got positive assets in return for all of them.

With 22 first round draft assets (18 picks + 4 swaps) through 2026, the Thunder's rebuild is well on its way with nice young pieces like SGA, Dort, Bazley, Poku, Maledon, already on the team. I'm not sure how long it takes for them to get back into the Western Conference playoff picture, but they've certainly given themselves a hell of a springboard.

Wait...shouldn't Dr. J be seen as a consensus top ten all-time player?,"A young Julius Erving truly was the Michael Jordan of the ABA, or the American Basketball Association, which rivaled the NBA at the time.  From 1970-1976, when the ABA merged with the NBA, every piece of information indicates that the leagues were on equal footing in terms of talent; the ABA was 79-76 in exhibition games that they played.  In addition, Erving played against NBA superstars such as Rick Barry, George Gervin, David Thompson, Artis Gilmore, and Moses Malone while he was in the ABA, all of which were overshadowed by Erving while they were in the ABA.  When Erving got to the NBA, he was forced to take fewer shots, but he was almost as dominant, particularly in the playoffs.  Anyways, to keep a long story short, here are some of Erving's basic accomplishments including his five years in the ABA.

Tyronn Lue gets a bad rap as a player because of the 2001 NBA finals and it's completely undeserved,"Tyronn Lue is iconized negatively for a game in which he was a legitimate impact player that almost helped the Lakers steal game 1 after being outplayed in a large portion of that game in the 2001 Finals. The Lakers were down 15 in the middle of the third quarter and Ty Lue was key in a lineup that brought the game back to only down 2 by the end of the third quarter.

&#x200B;

Let's paint the background here so that how Ty Lue helped makes sense. The Lakers had been completely dominant that post-season, outscoring teams by an average of 16.9 points per game before the finals, according to the game announcers. That is an insane number. To put into perspective how crazy that is, the 2020 Lakers dominated the Trailblazers and they won a 4-1 series by an average of 10.2 points per game. That team did that for the whole Western conference against a murderer's row of teams.

&#x200B;

As a little side-note, in these finals Phil Jackson was using some lineups that were way ahead of their time. He had what is basically today a 3-large-wing lineup with Horry at the 4 and also a 4 large shooters around Shaq lineup when Shaw would come in for Fisher. The Ty Lue lineup was also a little ahead of it's time because it put two playmakers together in the backcourt. Before then, usually an offense would run through a point guard and the number of large wings you could run an offense through was, as far as I remember, just Kobe and Tracy McGrady at the time. 

&#x200B;

The Lakers started out dominant, going up 13 in the early minutes of the 1st and it looked like they were going to blow the Sixers out like they had every other team before that time. The Sixers were heavy underdogs and everyone knew it. However, the Sixers didn't crumble after the Lakers' push and punched back. By the middle of the 3rd quarter, the Sixers were up 15, largely on the strengths of their ball pressure causing turnovers, forcing tough shots from Kobe, and flustering the Lakers offense by taking the ball out of Kobe's hands offensively before the Lakers reached half-court. 

&#x200B;

To solve this problem, the Lakers went to a back-court lineup with two ball-handlers who could withstand ball pressure and play make on the move ... I love Fisher, but handling ball pressure and playmaking by penetrating the defense is something Fisher was never good at and neither was Brian Shaw. Lue being put in ended up turning the game and made that game competitive and he was hugely beneficial for that 5-6 minute stretch.

&#x200B;

If the Lakers win this game, and it went into overtime, Lakers fans remember that this is the game that bringing Ty Lue in brought them back after they were down 15 and pressured like they never were before in that playoff run. Just the sheer idea of that team going down by 15 at any point of any game seems strange, but it actually happened, and Ty Lue was an important part of a really big comeback that could have ended up with the Lakers stealing this game despite being outplayed for a large portion of it.

&#x200B;

Something you also notice is that Ty Lue makes really fast reads. He is passing the ball as soon as it's in his hands and that's really helping the Lakers ball movement. He is also really fast and the Lakers getting the ball down the court fast means that they could play in a lot more early offense because the defense wasn't set. As a result of Ty Lue during that stretch, the ball got into Shaq more and the Lakers shooters had better shot quality.  Ty Lue legitimately turned the tide of the game in the 3rd quarters and the Lakers ended up significantly cutting the lead just within that quarter.",OpenPalm,k1niwu,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k1niwu/tyronn_lue_gets_a_bad_rap_as_a_player_because_of/,2020-11-26 23:13:23

Why Didn't the Cavaliers tear it down after LeBron James left in 2018?,"After getting swept in the 2018 Finals, LeBron James left his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers yet again, this time for the LA Lakers. After his departure, none of the moves that they made really made any sense: 

1. They signed Kevin Love(who was on an expiring contract) to a humongous 4 year/$120 million extension 

2. They held onto players like Tristan Thompson, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Dellvadova, and Brandon Knight instead of trading them for picks

3. They traded Rodney Hood for Nik Stauskas, Wade Baldwin IV, and two future second-round picks. As a decent bench piece, he could have gotten more than meme players, randos and late second rounders

4. They fired Tyronn Lue after an awful start. If they were rebuilding, which they needed to do, why? Let him lose and get a top draft pick. It's not like his replacement, Larry Drew, did much better: they went 19-63

5. They Picked Darius Garland in the 2019 draft. They didn't know he would turn out to be *the worst player in the NBA*. But, they already had an undersized, score-first point guard in Sexton. Why bring in another?

6. They traded for Andre Drummond despite, at the time, having multiple serviceable centers on the roster

7. They pushed out Coach Beilein despite signing him to a 5-year contract. Was he bad? Yes, but there was not much he could with that team

Despite all of their baffling and frankly terrible moves, I like their draft pick Isaac Okoro. Does anyone know why they did what they did?",Rahul____Raja,k0v0tj,125,178,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k0v0tj/why_didnt_the_cavaliers_tear_it_down_after_lebron/,2020-11-25 18:14:20

* Smaller rosters

* Better Covid Protocols (social distancing, fans have to test negative, and players seem to get tested more than their NFL counterparts)

"An update to the TV scorecard: ""Momentum Bar""","Whenever I switch to a game from another game, I sometimes find myself wondering which team has the momentum. Looking at the scoreboard doesn't give that information readily. I have to find an app and check the play-by-play commentary line by line.

Instead, I thought, perhaps networks can add a simple line below the scores that would inform us how the last five possessions of each team went down, thus letting us know which team has the momentum. Something like this:

https://i.imgur.com/oefQiM7.jpg

It doesn't have to be too detailed so as not to be distracting, but detailed enough to give us a momentarily snapshot of how the game is evolving. For instance, in this example, even though the Lakers are leading, it looks like the Jazz have the momentum. I thought it would be beneficial to know about this.

MacMullan on Kevin Garnett's Pre-Game Intensity,"\[MacMullan\] Avery Bradley told me he would get so worked up before games, and we're talking a regular season game or playoff game it didn't matter, that they'd all leave the locker room.

Kevin Garnett's intensity for the game was legendary on and off the floor. Celtics superfan Bill Simmons and esteemed reporter Jackie MacMullan discuss how seriously he took the game. To me, it just seemed like that sort of rugged brutality gave him an extraordinary peak, but often made it difficult for mesh with other teammates to win a championship (of course, he played an integral and pivoted part of the 2008 Boston Celtics championship).",MrMr5454,k18ix1,15,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k18ix1/macmullan_on_kevin_garnetts_pregame_intensity/,2020-11-26 06:42:50

Draymond led LeBron in every stat category but PPG, and if you gave him the same amount of shots, he would have been closer to that 25 PPG mark. He did this while averaging less turnovers AND minutes than LBJ and while playing elite defense.

He was the only player to ever average more than LeBron james in all 4 of those stat categories in a single season.

"Going into their 2nd years, who is the better prospect: RJ Barrett or Cam Reddish?","Reflecting after Zion, RJ and Cam's 1st year at Duke, the narrative that Zion overperformed expectations, RJ underperformed and Cam wayyyyy underperformed was pretty consistently agreed upon.  At this point, Zion is still head and shoulders above the other two (just have to pray he stays healthy) - but I think the discussing between who is more promising between RJ and Cam is an interesting debate.

Picked at number 3, RJ was expected immediately to be thrown in as a focal point of the Knicks, and as of right now, I think he's probably the only asset (maybe Mitchell Robinson as well) that the Knicks wouldn't be willing to part with.  Cam was picked in a lower stakes situation to the Hawks, where he was a lower priority behind Trae-Collins, but he started to come into his own in the second half of the year - especially as a capable wing defender.

Objectively, both played with horrendous efficiency - RJ Barrett fielded a shockingly bad 45% EFG and 40% FG, while Reddish fielded a 46% EFG with an egregious 38% FG.

Who would you more so expect to be a better prospect going forward?  Not sure if this is the popular opinion, but for his defensive performance in his first year alone I'd lean towards Reddish as of now.  Both players need to become much more efficient offensively to even be relevant, but I think RJ needs to fix more fundamental parts of his game since he can't rely on bully ball in all matchups, while also managing being a focal point of an offense. I think Cam has a bit more of a solid skill-set in place, while being surrounded by good players (Trae, Bogdan, Gallinari, Collins) and a potentially good system to help him thrive.",arithedoc,k151w3,51,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k151w3/going_into_their_2nd_years_who_is_the_better/,2020-11-26 02:52:59

It's interesting to see how, starting from the merger, teams were stacked. Then suddenly, for the 1990s and early 2000s, no teams were really stacked. I think the expansions and the dominance of the Jordan-Pippen and Kobe-Shaq duos played a big part in this.

Times a superstar made their role players worse,"Was thinking of how the Lakers got the most out of their role players last year and how Lebron helped his teammates thrive.

But was wondering if theres times Lebron made his role players worse at their game? And what about other superstars as well?",Common-Wedding-7264,k19ofb,28,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k19ofb/times_a_superstar_made_their_role_players_worse/,2020-11-26 08:02:59

A little confused...,"Hi brit here...

I've not long been watching basketball and the nba and ive read a lot about players having an ""All-Star season"" or being an all-star such as Siakam or Ingram.

What does it mean to be an ""All-Star"" ? Do you have to average certain numbers over the season to be an ""All-Star"" ? 
Can someone help me understand this better please ?

Thanks",bigbags420,k16yoh,22,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k16yoh/a_little_confused/,2020-11-26 04:56:12
What is the distinction between “Playmaking” and “Passing”?,"So for a while now my definition has been-

Passing: A skill within playmaking which is attributed to the accuracy of passes. Pretty Self-Explanatory.

Playmaking: Including passing, a player’s abilties to get open looks for himself and other players, utilization of offball tools likes screens.

Is there something else I need to know? Or are my definitions wrong and I need to learn something new.",kd-is-not-a-snake,k166g2,47,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k166g2/what_is_the_distinction_between_playmaking_and/,2020-11-26 04:05:37
What were the hardest and easiest championship runs? An advanced investigation.,"I, like many stumbled across u/barvader and his excellent analysis of the difficulty of every postseason playoff run from ‘84.  However I had a few problems with this.  

1. Use of SRS in a “combined” value. (More on this later)

2. Exclusion of playoff series from 1947-1983.  I believe every drip of NBA history is valuable and should be held to the upmost integrity.  I have improved on u/barvader ‘s article by recording the SRS values for those other 37 playoff runs. 

So, of course, I will be using SRS.  I believe it is by far the most accurate indication of team status among others [[1](https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2015/03/srs-calculation-details/)].  However, if you want to translate those values into a much more simple Win/Loss visual, you can use this equation {Expected Wins =((SRS/2+105)^15.3)/(((SRS/2+105)^15.3)+((105-SRS/2)^15.3))*82} to do so.  

Let’s finally get to the SRS evaluation that originated from u/barvader.  I call this “Combined SRS”. The problems with this is that it is not how SRS is supposed to be used [[2](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index4837.html?p=37)].  SRS isn’t ELo, you can’t use addition to truly get a grip on the strength of certain postseason contests.  The other thing is that it disinvites the pre 4 round playoff teams from 1947-1983.  Ok so here’s a list of all champions and their Combined SRS. 

*Sorry it’s so messy, I originally had it in a graph format but that doesn’t translate well to Reddit.  I also had too much varying info for it to be symmetrical.

These are the averages for each team.  Use that Expected Wins formula to translate these but for reference 5 SRS is roughly a 60 win pace. Above 7.5-8 is when you start getting into All-Time territory.  So the ‘72 Lakers were a 69 win team but had to play the 57 win Bulls (7.91 SRS), 63 win Bucks (10.7 SRS), and the 48 win Knicks (2.28 SRS).  This is a problem because the ‘72 Lakers were an All-Time level team with a 11.65 SRS.  We need to find how much of a difference a team has versus the competition it faces.  To do that we will simple subtract the Champions SRS from their average opponents. 

*Note: A lower score is better.

Things you should take from this:

•Hakeem Olajuwon had to go through some of the most ruthless teams of All-Time. He may have had Clyde Drexler, Robert Horry, and Kenny Smith but those Rockets teams simply weren’t as good as their competition.  Hakeem finished 14th in WS/48 (.181), 8th in BPM (5.4), and 8th in VORP (5.4).  In the Playoffs these metrics actually went down to 19th in WS/48 (.143), 10th in BPM (5.4), but led the Playoffs in VORP (1.7). 

•The ‘71 Bucks boast the highest SRS of All-Time (11.91).  Kareem cemented his legacy by his 2nd season and Oscar Robertson arrival propelled the already great bucks to the greatest team of All-Time [[3](https://www.brewhoop.com/2012/8/23/3259639/best-trade-ever-oscar-robertson-kareem-abdul-jabbar-bucks-lakers)]. The Bucks avoided the mistakes of the Philadelphia Warriors and refused to allow Kareem to play “Wilt ball” and instead added an MVP secondary piece that Wilt never had until he left in free agency to join Jerry West in Hollywood. 

•Underdogs are appropriately represented in this collection.  You’ll see the 2011 Mavericks and 2016 Cavaliers lower in this.",Riberty-and-Justice,k1286u,16,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k1286u/what_were_the_hardest_and_easiest_championship/,2020-11-26 00:14:27
We should be rooting for Giannis to stay in Milwaukee,"Not because I care about small markets. 
  
Not because i care about a bunch of pale weirdos who wear cheese. 
  
But because this is as much parity as the league has had in a long time. Were you happy when Lebron formed a superteam in Miami? Were you excited when KD joined Golden State? What do we think Giannis will do if he leaves Milwaukee? He obviously wont go to a worse situation.   
  
Would you rather Giannis play with Jrue and khris middleton? Or go join team up with Steph Curry? And klay and dray. Or go to the team that just went to game 6 of the nba finals? Or to dallas where he and luka and KP will dominate the nba for the next decade?   
  
The chaos of a superstar changing teams is fun until you realize oh hes just forming another superteam. The league is awesome right now. Theres more than a few teams in each conference that have realistic chances at making finals runs. No dominant team that ruins it for everyone else.

Is 2009 Dwight Howard and Lebron the most athletic duo in modern NBA history?,"2009 had Lebron and Dwight at the peak of their athletic powers. Dwight was a good 265 + with a near 40 inch vertical(39.5 measured), with incredible mobility. Lebron was 260 ish with a 40 + inch vertical who was also probably a top 3-5 guy in the league in terms of pure speed. 

Has there ever been a better athletic duo that existed in modern NBA history?

How would the game look if points scored scaled linearly with distance of the shot?,"For the sake of maximizing points per possession, most teams try to go for high % dunks and layups near the rim or higher value 3s. 

But how would the strategy and players change if the points scored was directly proportional to how far they were when they took the shot? 

Let's assume we have some special tech in the floors and cameras to perfectly measure where the player took a shot and ignore the fact it would be confusing as hell to keep track of score as a spectator.

**Some rule clarifications**

* We'll use the point where the rim attaches to the backboard as the starting point and the current corner 3 distance for the threshold for 3 point shots
* Points are given based on when the player last made contact with the ground before the shot was released (there will probably be lots of weird edge cases to consider)

For reference

* 1 inch = 0.0037878 extra points
* 0 inches away from the backboard = 2 points
* Free throws = 1 point
* 22 Ft (corner threes) = 3 points
* Non-corner 3pt line = 3.079 pts
* Shot from the free throw line = 2.682 points
* Half-court = 3.954 points",Sejhal,k0vclc,29,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k0vclc/how_would_the_game_look_if_points_scored_scaled/,2020-11-25 18:31:25

[Stein] Many rival teams also expect the Clippers to trade Lou Williams in their quest to create a fresh-start environment after they blew a 3-1 series lead to the Nuggets.,"In Marc Stein’s recent newsletter, he brings up the moves the Clippers have made to improve team chemistry with adding Luke Kennard & Serge Ibaka, while seeing Trezz go to the Lakers. He also indicates they are not done.

> Many rival teams also expect the Clippers to trade Lou Williams in their quest to create a fresh-start environment after they blew a 3-1 series lead to the Nuggets.

> How Paul George rebounds from a poor postseason and how much influence an all-new coaching staff led by Tyronn Lue wields are key factors in the Clippers’ ability to stay in the same orbit as a Lakers roster widely deemed stronger than the championship group of 2019-20. Yet just knowing that the Clippers will keep trying ensures that Los Angeles, as it was in the first 72 hours of free agency, will remain one of the league capitals of intrigue.

Since Lou Will is a relative bargain at 8 million/year, will be interesting to see who they could go after. I imagine they’d look at Derrick Rose since they have basically the same contract.

**CHARLOTTE HORNETS**

***the puzzle***

In his glory days, Charlotte GM Mitch Kupchak oversaw championship teams with the Los Angeles Lakers. He deserves credit for that; it's never easy to win one title, let alone *repeat.*

Kupchak is on the verge of an even more unique achievement: repeat ""worst contracts of the year"" awards. His Hornets were universally mocked for overpaying for Terry Rozier last year (3 years, $58M), and he's getting mocked once again for overpaying Gordon Hayward (4 years, $120M) this offseason.

Hayward is a good player and a former All-Star, but he hasn't been the same player since his gruesome leg injury in 2017. Hayward had a solid season (17.5 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.1 assists) but didn't showcase much explosiveness. The idea of paying him $25-30M could potentially be justified right now -- at age 30 -- but will look worse and worse as the years go on and all those miles keep adding up. There's a chance this contract is rancid by year 3.

Odder still, these Hornets are not ""one player away"" from making waves. By most advanced metrics, they were a bottom 5 team this season (bottom 5 in point differential, bottom 5 in offensive rating, bottom 5 in SRS power ranking, etc.) Given how big of a hole they're in, it would have made more sense to stay in a holding pattern and look forward to the stacked draft classes in 2021 and 2022. 

***the answer key***

As much as we'd like simple and rational answers to everything, life isn't that clean cut. We can't ignore the human factors at play. The idea of the Charlotte Hornets waiting and adding top lottery picks in 2021 and 2022 makes a lot of sense on paper -- but it presumes that you're going to be *around* in 2021 and 2022 and beyond. I don't know if Mitch Kupchak and coach James Borrego had that luxury. If they stunk up the joint this season and regressed from their 9th seed (which was an overachievement), then they may have been fired.

Instead, they decided to forge ahead and improve their W-L record without a full-blown tank. In a way, you can understand that, too. The primary reason that teams sag to the bottom is because they want to find franchise-altering superstars in the draft. The Hornets haven't had that since Kemba Walker (if *ever*.) But maybe, just maybe, they HAVE that franchise player now in # 3 pick LaMelo Ball. I'm skeptical of the kid myself, but there are plenty of smart people who buy into him completely. ESPN's *Draft Express* crew have been saying he's the clear-cut best prospect in the class, a confidence they had in Luka Doncic a few years prior.

If you're the Hornets, you're gambling on LaMelo Ball being the real deal. And if that's the case, you need to do everything in your power to provide him in a good situation. Throwing him out there to the wolves with a bad supporting cast and a league hungry to humble him may have been a downright disaster. And what then? Would the 19-year-old Ball have handled that well? Would his confidence be shaken? Would the whole locker room turn into a media feeding frenzy? Perhaps the toxic situation would have gobbled LaMelo Ball into the void, in the same way rookie quarterbacks can be ruined by bad setups (google David Carr, Derek's brother.)

In the NFL, teams often find ""bridge"" quarterbacks to give their young rookies some time to develop. Gordon Hayward's not going to block LaMelo Ball's path to playing time, but he's going to serve as a bridge to take some bullets for him and take some defensive attention away. As a lead dog again, Hayward could flirt with 20 PPG and possibly crack the All-Star team again. With two decent guards in Devonte' Graham and Terry Rozier, a decent big in Cody Zeller, and a promising sophomore in P.J. Washington, this team could potentially chase a .500 record.

Will the Hornets be a .500 team this year? Will they be a playoff team? Who knows. But at the very least, they'll be an *interesting* team. At least they'll be a relevant team. And for a franchise that may have been the most forgotten and anonymous in the NBA, we can't call this offseason a complete disaster. They made waves. Now it's up to them to see if they can ride them out or crash under the current.

**HOUSTON ROCKETS**

***the puzzle***

All season, there were warning signs that the Houston Rockets franchise may be hazardous situation and prime for a potential explosion. Daryl Morey and Mike D'Antoni saw the warning signs, and cruised out of there before everything [blew up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqz5dbs5zmo). There's a chance those two will meet again in the Eastern Conference Finals next year (Morey with Philly, D'Antoni with Brooklyn.)

As for Houston...? They're a fiery mess that's gone from title contender to punchline.

So far, they have *not* traded James Harden. They have *not* traded Russell Westbrook. Yet, oddly, they traded away an ideal 3+D partner for those two in Robert Covington. They're effectively still in ""win now!"" mode, without giving their stars the tools to actually win now.

And oh yeah: Tilman Fertitta is a douchebag. 

***the answer key***

First of all, we have to empathize with new GM Rafael Stone here. Nothing we've seen so far is *his* fault. He inherited a tough situation and a tough job here. Being an executive under Tilman Fertitta isn't just like working with one hand tied behind your back, it's like working when you're tied up like [Marsellus Wallace.](https://images.app.goo.gl/PBySvnBiWFCWp6Fn7)

Still, I appreciate that Stone hasn't panicked and traded James Harden yet. It'd almost be impossible to get fair value out of a superstar like Harden. We're talking about a player who has finished in the top 3 for MVP voting for FOUR straight seasons for a reason. He's one of the most efficient volume scorers of all-time. He's one of the most *durable* superstars in the NBA as well. You can love him or hate him, but having James Harden almost guarantees that you can make the playoffs no matter what. You don't find those guys easily. In fact, the Rockets could own every single draft pick next year (1 through 60) and probably not find anyone who will be as good as James Harden is right now.

Of course, just because James Harden can win 45-50 games with a bad supporting cast doesn't mean he should *have* to. So what's up with the Robert Covington trade? Why send away an ideal 3+D guy like that?

Essentially, the Rockets gave up Covington and his salary in order to sign Christian Wood. They were hamstrung by Russell Westbrook's salary ($44M + $47M) and forced to make difficult decisions like that. While Covington is a good player, so is Christian Wood. He's been productive every step of his career, and can provide the team with some more size and dynamism in their frontcourt.

Ultimately, that decision may be less about Robert Covington and Christian Wood and more about P.J. Tucker. Tucker's an admirable, gritty player who did well playing ""up"" at center this year. That said, he's 35 years old right now and will be 36 by the time the next playoffs roll around. It's difficult to ask a 36-year-old Tucker (at 6'5"") to match up with the Anthony Davises of the world. If the Western Conference is going to go through the Lakers, the Rockets may need more size to give themselves a puncher's chance.

---

**DETROIT PISTONS**

***the puzzle***

The Detroit Pistons hired a promising executive in Troy Weaver, a long-time lieutenant of Sam Presti in Oklahoma City. Presumably, Weaver would take a cue from Presti's direction in OKC and go for a full rebuilding situation here in the Motor City as well.

The team made all indications of that early on. They traded away Luke Kennard and didn't re-sign Christian Wood. They drafted a teenage PG in Killian Hayes to be the new face of the franchise. Hayes needs some runway before he can be counted on as a starter, but he has a lot of promise to be a leading scorer down the road in 2022 or 2023 or so.

But then... something changed. It's almost like Troy Weaver woke up with amnesia and forgot his own gameplan. Rather than build for the future, he signed veterans like Jerami Grant (3 years, $60M) and Mason Plumlee (3 years, $25M). While I like both of them in a vacuum, they're not exactly young studs. Plumlee is 30 -- Jerami Grant is 26. Both of them are older than the veterans they cast aside (in Kennard and Wood.) The same can be said about another trade acquisition in Delon Wright. While Wright's a good player, he's no spring chicken at age 28.

Odder still, none of these new pieces appear to fit well with the cornerstone players Blake Griffin or Killian Hayes. Whether you're building around Griffin in the short term or Hayes in the long term, those stars need to be surrounded by shooting to maximize their potential. With the exception of Svi Mykhailiuk and (potentially) Saddiq Bey, this is a roster that has very little spacing so far. It's a concern with Weaver's team building so far, especially given how OKC struggled with spacing for so many years.

***the answer key***

This is a difficult one to figure out, because I'm not sure that I fully understand the grand plan here. Some teams go up, some teams go down. Some teams zig while everyone else zags. Right now, it feels like Weaver is just drawing random squiggles and hope the dots connect somehow.

If you're going to make a defense here, it'd be that the offseason isn't finished yet. And even when the season starts, your plan isn't finished yet either. By collecting this strange hodgepodge of talent, Weaver has at least kept his options open.

If the Pistons roll into next season as is, they at least give Blake Griffin and company the opportunity to be competitive. The last time Griffin played a full season, the Pistons went 41-41 and made the playoffs. With the Orlando Magic presumably taking a step back, that 8th seed is wide open again.

More likely, the Pistons *won't* be the 8th seed. They *won't* be sneakily competitive. But if that's the case, they still have options. Blake Griffin's trade value may be low right now because teams aren't sure if he's healthy and back near 100%. If Griffin comes back strong in the first month or two, his value will jump up again. If that's the case (Griffin plays well but the team isn't there yet), the Pistons can pivot and deal him to a contender. They'll also have that option with Derrick Rose (on an expiring) and other pieces as well.

In the meantime, the Pistons are taking a similar approach to Charlotte. They're going to build the team around their draft pick (Killian Hayes), but they're going to try and give him as much of a buffer as they can by surrounding him with decent veterans in the meantime. Is that the way that *I'd* rebuild? Probably not. But it's not pure insanity; there's a method to this madness. And time will tell whether they're crazy like a fox or just crazy as fuck.",ZandrickEllison,k0slnh,38,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k0slnh/oc_the_craptologist_trying_to_decode_the/,2020-11-25 15:56:54

Craig isn't a great shooter and isn't as good of a defender as some think, he gets beat easily by most guards, he can't move over screens, but he's good at recovering.

Bryn Forbes is one of the worst defenders in the league. The Spurs went from one of the worst defenses in the league to one of the best whenever he was off the court. 

Portis is an inefficient scorer who can't play defense. He adds spacing but that's it. Stauskas is just garbage as a whole.

[OC] Hassan Whiteside the stretch/shooting big?,"Now that Hassan Whiteside has signed with the Kings I think it's important to analyze his potential as a stretch big in 2020-21. After not even attempting one 3 pointer in his first 5 seasons, Whiteside has had two amazing and one absolutely awful 3 point shooting season: 

**2017-18:** 100% 3P% (Holy crap that's elite for anyone let alone a center) 

**2018-19:** 12.5% 3P% (What the hell happened?)

**2019-20:** 57.1% 3P% (Back to his elite shooting ways. Still not as great as his 2017-18 shooting campaign, though)

The Fruits of the Process,"I was thinking about this in the context of Jerami Grant getting $$$$, but I had forgotten that he was a former Sixer who had signed a Hinkie special contract with 3 unguaranteed years of team control for 2nd Rounders.  It got me thinking about the evaluations of Hinkie and the process and I realized how good a job Hinkie did. 

The Process had a few main parts:

1. Suck to get the best chance at top picks for the best chance at a star.
2. Cycle through guys at the back end of your roster to try to find good role players.
3. Use your cap space to take on bad contracts for more draft assets.

The net result was a bevy of high picks and young talent.  It's easy to complain that Hinkie's three first round picks during his 2.5 years there were Nerlens Noel, Joel Embiid, and Jahlil Okafor.  However, if you take just the roster that he left when he resigned in 2015, not add any free agents, and pick the guys who were drafted, you get this roster:

&#x200B;

PG - Ben Simmons - 2016 1st Round Pick

SG - Landry Shamet - 2018 1st Rounder from Elfrid Payton trade with Orlando - Traded for Tobias

F - Mikal Bridges - 2018 1st Rounder gotten back from Orlando in Elfrid Payton Trade - Traded for Zhaire Smith

PF - Jerami Grant - 2014 2nd Round Pick - Traded to the Thunder for Ersan Ilyasova and a 2020 1st (Tyrese Maxey)

C - Joel Embiid - 2014 1st Round Pick

Bench

G - TJ McConnell - 2015 Free Agent

G - Romeo Langford - 2019 1st Round Pick from Sacramento from Stauskas dump - Traded for Fultz

F - Robert Covington - 2014 Free Agent - Traded for Jimmy Butler

F/C - Nerlens Noel - 2013 1st Round Pick

C - Christian Wood - 2015 UDFA 

C - Richaun Holmes - 2015 2nd Round Pick

&#x200B;

This team would easily be Top 3 in the East.  It's still a little weak at the guard spot, but there's a good combination of wings and shooters and backup bigs to complement Ben and Joel.  This doesn't even account for the shitshow of the Tatum-Fultz swap and assumes that Boston never would have traded down if they thought Philadelphia would have taken Tatum.  There's also plenty of cap space to add in another guard or two.

This is also an incredible indictment of the Colangelo and Brand eras.  There was so much waste of the draft assets that Hinkie had accumulated, a horrible contract for Tobias that got this team close to the tax, and appalling mismanagement of talent.  

I get that this is well-trod territory, but seeing the new deals for Wood and Grant over free agency really helps show the practical effects of cycling through back of the roster guys and makes it worth looking at again.",Rex_Burkhead,k14654,13,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k14654/the_fruits_of_the_process/,2020-11-26 01:59:09

HOF Guard & Former Detroit Mayor Dave Bing Turned 77 Years Old Yesterday,"Dave Bing was born & raised in Washington D.C. then on to play college basketball at the University of Syracuse from 1963 to 1966.

The Detroit Pistons selected Bing, a 6'3 combo guard, with the #2 pick of the 1966 NBA Draft.  During his 12 year HOF career, Bing played for the Pistons, Bullets & Celtics.

Bing is a 7x All-Star & won the All-Star Game MVP in 1976.  Bing was selected to the All-NBA 1st Team in 1968 & 1971 & to the All-NBA 2nd Team in 1974.

Bing's career averages are 20 points, 6 assists & 3 rebounds while shooting 44% from the floor & 77% from the line.

In 1967, Bing won the NBA's Rookie of Year award after averaging 20 points, 4 rebounds & 4 assists in 80 games.

In 1968, Bing led the league in total points & finished 4th in MVP voting after putting up 27 points, 6 assists & 4 rebounds for the Pistons.

In 1971, Bing finished 3rd in MVP voting after averaging 27 points, 5 assists & 4 rebounds and led the Pistons to 45 wins, which was 6th best record in the league.

Bing led the league in free throw attempts & made free throws in 1971.  Bing finished 4th in scoring that year as well.

Bing averaged 22 points, 6 assists & 4 rebounds during his 9 year stint with the Detroit Pistons.

After retiring from the league in 1978, Bing founded Bing Steel, a steel processing company in Detroit.  By its second year in business, Bing Steel posted revenues of $4.2 million in 1981.

In 1984, Bing was awarded the National Minority Small Business Person of the Year by President Reagan.

Bing was selected to the Basketball HOF in 1990.

Bing sold off the company's assets in 2009.

On October 16, 2008, Bing announced that he would be a candidate for the Mayor of Detroit in the 2009 Detroit mayoral special election. 

On February 24, 2009, Bing finished 1st in a 15 candidate non-partisan primary.

On May 5, 2009, the top 2 vote-getters faced off and he defeated interim Mayor Kenneth Cockrel Jr. and was elected to complete former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick's term, which ended December 31, 2009.

Kilpatrick had resigned as part of a plea bargain agreement after being charged with the crime of perjury.

On November 3, 2009, Bing was re-elected to a full term as mayor of Detroit.

During his term as mayor, Detroit became the largest city in U.S. history to declare bankruptcy.

Bing announced on May 14, 2013, he would not run for re-election.",KingofIronIslands,k0zsk5,4,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k0zsk5/hof_guard_former_detroit_mayor_dave_bing_turned/,2020-11-25 22:08:10

Here’s a Possibility: Early Vaccine access for the NBA,"Pfizer has already submitted an emergency use authorization application for their vaccine with the FDA and it’s likely going to be receiving approval on December 10th. Moderna is also going to be submitting an application next week and approval for theirs won’t be much long after.

What does that mean for the NBA? We’ll these initial vaccine doses are supposed to be marked for vulnerable populations like healthcare workers, nursing home patients and those 65 and older. But in practice (just like we saw early on in the Pandemic when the NBA had access to testing before testing became generally available), I would not be surprised to see the NBA getting access to these vaccines early before they become generally available in March/April. Which in theory means you could see NBA Players getting vaccinated even before the season begins. And you’ll likely see teams getting vaccinated throughout the season.

COVID precautions will of course impact the next season, but thanks to vaccines the impact could potentially be minimal depending on when teams get vaccinated.

Better talent: Bam Adebayo or Deandre Ayton?,"Basically, just going off plain potential, who’s better?

Ayton was the first pick and is often overshadowed by his peers Luka and Trae. But he is no joke at all. He’s already a walking 20 and 10 when he’s not on diuretics. 

Bam has a lot of potential with his shot, if he can extend an already solid shot to the 3-pt line. 

But same can be said for Ayton about his shot. His form mechanics already work.

Ayton will probably never be the passer Bam is, but his post game  can be more valuable in given time.

And defensively, I see a lot of upside to both of them. Bam is more versatile because of his perimeter defense, but I could see Ayton effectively playing the Embiid or Gobert role on defense and anchoring the paint protection if he continues to grow on defense, which he already has.

Scoring wise, I think he already may be better than Bam at scoring, but that’s just me. I do still think it’s a given in the future though.

"Why do people like Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Allen Iverson, Ray Allen, etc. Not be viewed as top 10 players today when they were 25-30+ PPG scores in a more difficult defensive era?","I find that when people pose this question about ""where would X NBA All-Star from 20 years ago be ranked today"" and pretty much anyone other than Kobe, Duncan, Garnett, or Shaq get shafted.

The players I mentioned were 25-30+ PPG scorers in an era where there were less fouls called. Less free-throw shooting, more physical contact, more paint-protection. Their statistics are essentially the same as today's top players and I don't see how they wouldn't have an improvement in their offensive game. 

A better question would be how would today's players be able to play in their era. How would Giannis be able to  score against a 99-00 Knicks team with Latrell Sprewell guarding him and having Camby or Ewing wait for him in the pain with a more physical and intense style of defense.

"[Anderson] Sources have suggested Bogdanovic would prefer to move on, saying the 28-year-old shooting guard feels he has been “de-prioritized” by the Kings organization.","> The Kings had earmarked $15 million to $18 million for Bogdanovic with the belief that the salary cap would increase to $115 million. Bogdanovic’s camp was already signaling a willingness to play hardball in those negotiations after Hield and Harrison Barnes received fatter contracts — with statistical analysis suggesting Bogdanovic was better — but Divac was confident he could get a deal done. Then the coronavirus pandemic caused billions in revenue losses, Divac was removed from his post and the Kings hired McNair to figure out how the pieces fit under a salary cap that remained flat at $109.1 million.

> There are some legitimate reasons for McNair to let Bogdanovic go. Sources have suggested Bogdanovic would prefer to move on, saying the 28-year-old shooting guard feels he has been “de-prioritized” by the Kings organization.

> In addition, bringing Bogdanovic back could limit McNair’s future roster and salary cap flexibility and slow any plans of an immediate rebuild around 22-year-old point guard De’Aaron Fox, 21-year-old forward Marvin Bagley III and 20-year-old rookie first-round draft pick Tyrese Haliburton.

Brandon Ingram was drafted in 2016, so his contract extension kicks in this season.

De'Aaron Fox was drafted in 2017, so his contract extension kicks in next season.

And since the cap is projected to be higher next year than it is this year, Fox's extension is projected to be worth more than Ingram's.

"In June 2015, Luke Ridnour was traded four times in the span of six days","
I recently saw a report about the NBA being a ""though Business"" after they talked about how Trevor Ariza got 3 times during this week.

As I read that article, this story from 2015 came to my mind when Luke Ridnour got traded 4 times within 6 days:

On June 24, he was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for the draft rights to Jānis Timma. 

On June 25, the Grizzlies sent him to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Matt Barnes.

later that same day he was traded, along with a 2016 second-round draft pick, to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Jeremy Lamb.

Lastly, on June 30, Ridnour was traded to the Toronto Raptors along with cash considerations in exchange for the draft rights to Tomislav Zubčić.

Ridnour later stated in an interview with *USA Today* that he found the whole situation rather ""funny"", as he and his family were present at their home in Seattle while the moves were unfolding.

On July 9, 2015, he was waived by the Raptors.

On September 21, 2015, Ridnour announced his decision to sit out the 2015–16 season.

SG - Killian Hayes (7) - He'll have an opportunity in Detroit and I think he'll be a solid 2 guard with them

SF - Aleksej Pokuševski (17) - He may be raw af but he'll get minutes with the current Thunder roster right now (Shai-Dort-Poku-Bazley-Horford). I don't think they'll use Ariza to increase his value. Ariza's just living with his reputation anyway at this point

PF - Obi Toppin (8) - He'll have the opportunity in NY. His defense may be a suspect but his offense can outweigh his lack in defensive side

C - James Wiseman (3) - He'll have quality minutes as Golden State's center. He'll benefit from Curry's gravity and Draymond's leadership.

Jimmy Butler is Gravy.

MASHED POTATOES - A solid all around food, but let’s be honest. Nobody comes to Thanksgiving Dinner for the Mashed Potatoes, but you’re glad they’re there when you get there. Reminds me a lot of Khris Middleton. Nobody goes to Milwaukee Bucks games to watch Khris Middleton. But when you get there and Giannis is only playing 15 minutes that night, you’re sure glad Khris Middleton is there. 

SWEET POTATOES - Everyone always tells me how good Sweet Potatoes are every year, that I’m going to like them more as I get older, but every year I try the sweet potatoes, I’m still disappointed. A few years ago  I tried to mix Gravy with my sweet potatoes, but the gravy ended up teaming up with some leftovers from the fridge to try and get away from the Sweet Potatoes. I gotta say, Sweet Potatoes sure do remind me of Karl Anthony Towns. 

PUMPKIN PIE - The finisher, someone who you know you can call on at the end of the meal to top you off good. Someone who wants the spotlight, someone who wants to take the shot that gives a city it’s championship. That person is legendary 3 point shooter Dwight Howard.",IHateNerdsShutUpNerd,k0y8kx,31,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k0y8kx/if_thanksgiving_dishes_were_nba_players_who_would/,2020-11-25 20:52:36

Exum looked like a future two way point guard and he was the best point guard in what people thought was a stacked draft class. Finally, I thought Kris Dunn would be amazing.

You wouldn’t think that Mike is sitting here watching a G League game on you.”

"Who’s a better GM, Danny Ainge (Celtics) or Travis Shlenk (Hawks).","Pros of Ainge:
- Pulled off one of the most lopsided trades in the history of the NBA, setting up the Celtics for at least a decade of contention. 

- Great at getting stars like Kyrie Irving and (at the time) Gordon Hayward to sign with the Celtics. 

- Team has been consistently successful ever since he was at the helm.

- Won a championship in 2008

- Good at drafting early, getting players like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.

Cons of Ainge

- Always tries to fleece the other team, never does the simple trade.

- Tends to let stars walk for nothing

- Almost blew the Celtics perfect rebuild. He tried to give up six future picks, four of them first rounders, for Justise Winslow.

- Struggles to draft good players outside of the lottery, taking players like James Young, Jared Sullinger, Fab Melo, RJ Hunter, Ante Zizic, and Guershon Yabusele. 

Pros for Shlenk

- Has Atlanta back in playoff position after only four years of rebuilding.

- Helped build the Warriors dynasty as Assistant GM to Bob Myers.

- Very good at drafting value picks. Drafted John Collins and Kevin Huerter at 19, Cam Reddish at 10, and Trae Young at 5. 

Cons for Shlenk

- Tends to reach for players, De’Andre Hunter and Onyeka Okongwu could have been acquired later in the draft.

- Traded Luka Doncic

- Questionable long-term moves in the 2020 offseason.

Some of the Hawks' off-season moves make no sense if they intend to extend John Collins.,"Hawks extending Collins should be a no-brainer. 

Despite all the hot takes in here, there is no world where you don't extend a 23 year-old giving you 20/10 a night and then give a 32 year old injury prone Gallinari 60 million. It would be the height of incompetency to not re-sign Collins, which makes some of these off-season moves questionable.

I will start off by saying the Dunn and Rondo signings are really good and smart 2 year cheap deals.

My first problem is the Gallo signing. He's good but is he 20 million/year good? If they have to extend Collins, they need to clear a max slot and I would assume they'd move Gallo so maybe this one isn't so hard, but his injury history leaves a lot to be desired with and can potentially make his contract unmovable if he were to go down.

My biggest gripe is the Bogdanovic signing. The money is decent but the length of the contract basically kills the Hawks' chances of improving via free agency in the next 4 years. Bogdanovic imo, isn't that big of an improvement over Huerter, who is probably on a trajectory to being a similar/better than him in a few seasons. I would've loved to see Hawks back some of their young guys with a starting spot. Huerter and Reddish competing for a starting spot at Shooting Guard on a team with playoff aspirations would've been really good for their development, now they have to fight for a 2nd string spot, not to mention the implications it has on a Collins extension. I don't particularly like this move like most of you.",JeffVanGundyBurner,k0mdrc,80,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k0mdrc/some_of_the_hawks_offseason_moves_make_no_sense/,2020-11-25 07:55:51

Who will be the next Villain of the NBA?,"I love when the NBA has a villain. It was Lebron for a few years after LeDecision, and he played into that role perfectly. Then it was the KD Warriors, who also played the part well. But right now there really is no true villain in the NBA.

Lakers are the favorites but that’s different from a villain. At this point Lebron and AD are too likable to play into that role—people hate on Lebron but it’s mostly trolling at this point.

KD and Kyrie I could see if they end up having a great season, especially if they get Harden.

Clippers? You could make the argument it was them last year but to be a truly great villain you need respect from your peers and the Clippers have none of that at the moment.

If Giannis dips to LA or Miami he could definitely be that dude, but I don’t see that happening.

The Sixers are a sleeper here imo. Embiid and Simmons have that reputation for being shit-talkers that can’t back it up, so they’re sure to piss of a lot of people if they have a legitimately great year. I don’t know if the team is good enough though.

Immediately one of the deepest teams in the league, their second unit is good enough to be a bottom tier NBA-caliber starting lineup.  No excuses not to make the playoffs next year.",arithedoc,k0kqcs,72,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k0kqcs/hawks_depth_chart/,2020-11-25 06:02:04
Is Sam Presti the NBA's new Hinkie?,"Presti has traded away every quality NBA player in an apparent attempt to become the first team with every lottery pick in the draft. Now they have Horford, Ariza, George Hill as experienced NBA players. The rest are on rookie contracts (incl. SGA & Dort). 

Presti is most likely going to flip Horford after boosting his value. Ariza and George Hill will probably be waived or moved for picks. Soon OKC's roster will be an homage to the 76ers G-league roster fighting for 20 wins.

It's clear that Presti is trying to tank and is employing the same tactic as Hinkie with ""The Process"". After what happened to Hinkie being blackballed by the league, will Presti be punished by the league office like Hinkie and become a pariah?",PatrickJane123,k0rost,33,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k0rost/is_sam_presti_the_nbas_new_hinkie/,2020-11-25 14:55:54
I watched and timed stamped notes of the only games of Bill Russell on Youtube.,"&#x200B;

I could only find 8 games of substantial length of Bill Russell on Youtube. I decided to watch them, take notes and time stamp every action I thought carried impact. I then put my notes into the categories of: Rim Running, Rebounding, Finishing, Rim Protection, Post Ups, and Perimeter Defense. My first time ever doing something like this,would love some feedback, and also thought this would interest a lot of people here.

Also just wanted say a lot of what i noted were the result of schematic decisions and not the fault of Russell, for example some the concessions of jumpshots, or staying attached to Wilt instead of chasing a block. I tried to be more descriptive than prescriptive. Also should have noted more of his defensive rebounds, those are definitely impactful plays.",jozeyjoe,k0aot2,14,230,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k0aot2/i_watched_and_timed_stamped_notes_of_the_only/,2020-11-24 20:30:26
We all know who the big 3 PFs of the last era are... but who’s #4 and #5?,"The top 3 are OBVIOUSLY Duncan, KG and Dirk, but the real question is who’s #4 and #5. And I’m talking about the 2000s era so no Anthony Davis.

In my opinion there’s only 2 answers. Pau Gasol or Chris Webber are the two best players left. 

Here’s the list i came up with, no this isnt in order or anything like that. Draft year is listed. LaMarcus Aldridge didn’t make the cut he was drafted a little too late. Did I forget anyone?

Pau Gasol - 2001

Chris Webber - 1993 

Rasheed Wallace - 1995

Amare stoudamire -2002 

Rashard Lewis - 1998

Carlos Boozer - 2002

Zach Randolph - 2001

Antawn Jamison - 1998

Elton Brand - 1999

David West - 2003

Lamar Odom - 1999

Kenyan Martin - 2000

Antoine Walker - 1996

Chris Bosh - 2003

Jermaine O’Neal - 1996

Lakers and Clippers fans: Are you able to tell apart Marcus and Markieff Morris in how they play?,"I like to think I know a decent amount about basketball, but I realize I can't really tell Marcus or Markieff apart in any meaningful way.  I know Marcus is the slightly better 3 point shooter and Markieff is arguably the better post defender, but not in extremely meaningful ways.  I doubt if Marcus checked in for Markieff on a random road game I would have any idea watching TV, or vice versa - I'd think ""oh, Markieff is shooting a little better tonight than usual"", or ""oh, Marcus is really playing great defense"" before I'd consider there was a switcheroo.

Marcus Morris career splits: 12.1 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 1.5 APG on 43/37/76 splits (Total points: 7326)

>Leading the pack, by far, is Hassan Whiteside. The big man reportedly has interest from Sacramento, who still has its full mid-level exception, but otherwise the league’s game of musical centers has mostly ended without him having a chair. A couple of other teams could use an extra center, notably Houston and Phoenix, but have just minimum or biannual exceptions remaining. And the team that should have signed him, Washington, opted for Robin Lopez (at $7.3 million!) instead. Aside from the Kings, one possibility to think about is Oklahoma City, which could sign him to a one-year deal and then trade him for – wait for it –more draft picks at the trade deadline. The Thunder could accomplish this with cap room or with their full mid-level exception, depending on how they manage the rest of their cap situation, but either way they can get to the right number.",j10kum2,k06f4i,104,418,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k06f4i/hollinger_leading_the_pack_by_far_is_hassan/,2020-11-24 16:54:08
Do you take anything from on/off numbers in a pretty large sample size ? Or is it still a flawed stat,"So I was looking at Demar Derozan's stats on bball ref and one thing jumped out :

\- In his career Demar's team has been better with him on the floor once, in 2012, now to be clear some years it was pretty close. It could be that Toronto and San Antonio always had strong benches, but even the years when he and Lowry were staggered, Lowry had positive on/off numbers while Derozan's were bad.

\- Those numbers are even worse in the playoffs (Idk how, but he somehow manage to have a -6,5 net rating on a team that went to the conference finals but hey it's about on/off thing so I wont talk net rating)

&#x200B;

Now I'm not the biggest Derozan fan,  I understand that some of his flaws (defense, no spacing) are pretty detrimental, and I always taught that Lowry was by far the best Toronto player but still I was surprised, some of those years he was pretty great, a legit all star level player (he never was all NBA level IMO but that's a whole othe thing).

So I wanted to ask in your opinions : is it fair to use those stats against him ? And more generally how big a sample size has to be for those stats to be used ?",TuqiDuque12,k0q9ix,14,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k0q9ix/do_you_take_anything_from_onoff_numbers_in_a/,2020-11-25 13:07:42

He’s shown consistently how he can raise his team to insane success. Nuggets will be a top 2 seed and he’ll be their best player by far.

DPOY: Anthony Davis
With added scoring from Schröder and Harrell, Davis can focus even more on locking down people on defense.

MIP: Jamal Murray
Following up his insane playoff run, Murray will keep his game elevated to close to that level, dramatically improving both his scoring and efficiency.

6MOY: Lou Williams
With his two main competitors in Schröder and Harrell taking away from each other’s scoring, Lou will can finally get another 6MOY

ROY: Bol Bol
Bol Bol showed flashes of greatness in the bubble scrimmages, including recording a 16/10 game with 6 blocks. He’ll bulk up in the off-season, and become another unicorn in the league.

"Chris Bosh has the same number of ASGs as Pau Gasol, Dennis Rodman, Lamar Odom and Draymond Green combined","Pau, Rodman and Green have a combined 11 all star games, and 8 All NBA nods. Bosh has 11 all star games and just 1 All NBA nod.

Pau missed the ASG while playing in Memphis and LA despite putting up numbers comparable to Bosh's Toronto and Miami numbers.

* 18/9/3 and 2 BPG
* 19/9/3 and 2 BPG
* 18/8/3 and 2 BPG (50 win team as the only star)
* 18/7/3 and 2 BPG (45 win team as the only star)
* 21/10/4 and 2 BPG
* 19/9/3 and 1.5 BPG (57 win team's 2nd best player)
* 18/11/4 and 1.5 BPG (50 win team's 2nd best player)
* 14/9/4 and 1.5 BPG (45 win team's 2nd best player)
* 18/10/4 and 1.5 BPG

I know there's been talks of it, but do we think the NBA will ever actually just take the top 24 players for the ASG and not be conference based? The forward slot dominated the West in the 2000s, and now it's the wing and guard slots that are stacked. Taking the top 24 would mean having the actual best 24 players and not having guys like Jamal Magloire, Kyle Korver or Roy Hibbert making the ASGs. 

All Star Games aren't a huge deal, but when they are used as qualifiers for the HOF, and legacies, it seems a little asinine to have a guy like Bosh who was very talented have 2x as many All Star nods as Pau Gasol or Chris Webber (two guys most folks would say are better players) and  3-4x as many as Draymond Green and Dennis Rodman two guys are are arguably as good as Bosh.

EDIT:

Very brief observations:

- (Going strictly by advanced stats) BEST regular-season performer: Harrell; WORST regular-season performer: Kuzma;  BEST playoff performer: Mathews/Schröder; WORST playoff performer: Harrell/Kuzma

- - Harrell nosedived from best overall regular season performer to arguably the worst in the entire group in the playoffs. Kuzma was consistently mediocre. Schröder in the playoffs was an enigma - horrendous scoring efficiency but absolutely insane on/off (**+31.3**). Mathews/KCP were the best playoff shooters. Gasol regressed in the playoffs. Caruso was consistently solid.

-  BEST regular-season scorer: Harrell; WORST regular season scorer: Caruso; BEST playoff scorer: Harrell; WORST playoff scorer: Gasol

- My own prediction as to who will be LAL's 3rd best player: either Gasol or Schröder -- Dennis seems reliable in his role, while Gasol has the potential to perform better than he showed in last playoffs",KagsTheOneAndOnly,k0ujj6,40,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k0ujj6/sooo_whos_gonna_be_the_lakers_3rd_best_player/,2020-11-25 17:48:58

"Let’s gather this holiday season and collect the one good thing this year brought us. That’s right, COVID memes.","Looked back and saw that my first social media post about a then nameless virus was on January 8th. I joked at the time that it’s “all I would be talking about for the foreseeable future” because I have a huge interest in zoonosis and emergent viruses.

Little did I know...

I quickly started waiting for the Chinese health ministry to release their daily reports at 9PM my time, then stayed up until about 12AM talking to users about what that data may mean.

Well. It’s been a year now and suffice it to say my first Reddit post, about a single suspected case in Brazos County, Texas, is soberingly insignificant in hindsight.

I’m sure I don’t need to tell anyone what a strange, and often bleak, year it’s been.

What I can tell you is that as a virologist who is usually alone in annoying people with my weird virus memes, that weird niche of content experienced a huge boom in 2020.

Let’s celebrate what little we got this year, and reflect back on what unites us all in this tumultuous time: the memes.",SecretAgentIceBat,k5m34d,124,314,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k5m34d/lets_gather_this_holiday_season_and_collect_the/,2020-12-03 02:16:54
